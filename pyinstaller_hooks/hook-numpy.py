"""
Tlamatini custom PyInstaller hook for numpy.

$PyInstaller-Hook-Priority: 2

Why this hook exists
--------------------
numpy 2.0 renamed ``numpy.core`` to ``numpy._core`` and kept ``numpy.core``
as a pure-Python deprecation shim. ``numpy/core/__init__.py`` uses
``__getattr__`` to forward every attribute access to ``numpy._core``.
However, the Windows wheels for numpy >= 2.x ALSO ship the compiled
extensions (``_multiarray_umath.pyd``, ``_multiarray_tests.pyd``,
``_simd.pyd``, etc.) under BOTH ``numpy/_core/`` and ``numpy/core/`` as
byte-for-byte duplicates, preserved for binary-level backward compat.

PyInstaller's stock numpy hook (priority 1) calls
``collect_dynamic_libs("numpy")``, which walks the numpy tree and bundles
every ``.pyd``/``.dll`` it finds — so both copies end up in the frozen app.
At runtime the same compiled extension is registered under two different
fully-qualified module names (``numpy._core._multiarray_umath`` and
``numpy.core._multiarray_umath``). numpy 2.x's one-init-per-process guard
in ``_multiarray_umath`` then raises:

    ImportError: cannot load module more than once per process

numpy 1.x had no duplicate layout (only ``numpy/core/`` existed) and its C
extension had no one-init guard, which is why older Tlamatini builds did
not hit this.

The fix
-------
Drop every binary whose source path lives under ``numpy/core/``. The
duplicates there are never actually needed: numpy.core's Python shim
forwards attribute access to ``numpy._core`` via ``__getattr__``, so
``numpy.core.X`` at runtime returns ``numpy._core.X``. We also add the
legacy numpy.core extension names to ``excludedimports`` so the module
graph walker does not pull the duplicate ``.pyd`` files back in if some
dependency happens to reference them directly.

This hook mirrors the stock PyInstaller numpy hook exactly, except for
the binaries filter and the added ``excludedimports`` entries — so future
upstream behavior changes keep working.
