"""
agent/self_healing.py — Self-aware, NEVER-HANGING, self-healing resilience for
Tlamatini's Multi-Turn model steps.

REDESIGN (Angela, 2026-07-06 — NOT a patch, and NOT "retry the same call"):

The failure that must NEVER happen again: ONE model call hung for 120 s, threw
out of the whole 4096-turn loop, discarded every agent that had already run, and
the chain LIED ("no tools were invoked"). Retrying the SAME hanging call is
useless — it just hangs again.

The correct behaviour, exactly as Angela specified:

  • Tlamatini MUST NOT HANG. Every model call runs under a WATCHDOG — if it does
    not answer within a bounded time, the call is ABANDONED (a daemon thread we
    stop waiting on) and she immediately moves on. She never blocks forever.

  • On each failure/timeout she switches to a genuinely DIFFERENT TACTIC to get
    the job done (normal → trim context → minimal request → drop-tools summary →
    patient retry …, then cycles), and she ANNOUNCES the new tactic to the user
    in the first person, live, as it happens — the user SEES the tactic change.

  • She keeps trying, tactic after tactic, up to her full turn budget (4096) and
    NEVER gives up on her own.

  • The ONLY thing that stops her is the USER (the Cancel button). Cancellation
    is checked every 0.25 s — even mid-hang, even on turn 3982. On cancel she
    finishes gracefully from the work already done (Create Flow button intact),
    never a lie, never a discarded run.

Mid-run first-person notifications are pushed to the browser through a
StatusBroadcaster the consumer registers per request (the same
run_coroutine_threadsafe bridge the Ask-Execs broker uses), so they render in
the chat live, as they happen.
