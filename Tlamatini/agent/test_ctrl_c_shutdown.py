"""Ctrl+C MUST ALWAYS QUIT — source contract for the shutdown path.

THE INCIDENT (Angela, 2026-08-29). The installed C:\\Tlamatini hung forever on
Ctrl+C. A py-spy dump of the live wedged process (PID 27308, 80 threads, all in
Wait, 0 progress) showed the MainThread carrying an ELEVEN-DEEP tower of
``signal_handler -> cleanup_pool_on_shutdown`` frames — one per Ctrl+C press
recorded in ``tlamatini.log`` — whose top was parked forever in::

    start (threading.py:999)          <- Thread.start()
    wait  (threading.py:655)          <- self._started.wait()   *** FOREVER ***

Two independent defects produced it:

1. ``signal_handler`` called ``cleanup_pool_on_shutdown()`` DIRECTLY. A Python
   signal handler runs ON THE MAIN THREAD, interrupting whatever it was doing,
   and that cleanup's first act is ``psutil.process_iter(['cmdline'])`` — it
   opens and reads the PEB of every process on the machine. Ctrl+C therefore
   looked dead for seconds, the user pressed again, and NOTHING guarded
   re-entry: each signal stacked a new cleanup on top of one already part way
   through NON-REENTRANT ``threading``/``psutil`` internals. The interrupted
   ``Thread.start()`` still held threading's global ``_active_limbo_lock`` (a
   plain, non-reentrant Lock), so the nested one could never complete —
   self-deadlock on the one thread that had to survive. ``os._exit(0)`` sat at
   the END of the handler and was never reached.

2. ``with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=1) as executor:`` around a
   ``future.result(timeout=5)``. The context manager's ``__exit__`` calls
   ``shutdown(wait=True)`` — an UNBOUNDED join that silently defeats the very
   timeout written beside it.

These tests pin the fix. They read SOURCE (the shutdown path lives inside
``AgentConfig.ready()`` and cannot be imported and signalled in a unit test), so
they are cheap, deterministic, and fail loudly the moment someone "simplifies"
the handler back into the deadlock.
