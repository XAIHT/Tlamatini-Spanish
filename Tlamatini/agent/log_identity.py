"""Per-line USER attribution for ``tlamatini.log`` (Angela, 2026-08-13).

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
Tlamatini serves SEVERAL logged-in users at once on the same machine — open a
session as ``angela`` and another as ``alice`` and both are served concurrently
by the same process, the same event loop and the same thread pool. Until this
module landed, ``tlamatini.log`` interleaved both users' work with **no way to
tell whose line was whose**: a Multi-Turn burst from alice and a RAG rebuild for
angela were one indistinguishable stream.

Every line that belongs to a user now carries a tiny prefix naming that user and
the turn (request) it came from:

    [a3] --- Message parsed: 'compile the report' ...
    [b1] --- [BINARY-GUARD] ENABLED - sampling 8192 bytes/file
    --- [WHO] a = angela (user id 1)          <- the one-time legend line

TWO HARD CONSTRAINTS, both from Angela, both honoured by construction
--------------------------------------------------------------------
1. **MINIMAL CHARACTERS.** The default tag is FIVE characters — ``[a3] `` — a
   one-letter user code plus the turn number, not a verbose
   ``[user=angela thread=Thread-42]`` preamble. Lines that belong to NO user
   (startup, the MCP servers, the reaper) get **no prefix at all**, so nothing
   is spent on them. Blank lines are never tagged either.
2. **MINIMAL CPU.** The prefix is rendered ONCE per (user, turn) and stored
   READY-TO-WRITE in a ``ContextVar``. The logging hot path therefore costs one
   ``ContextVar.get()`` plus one string concatenation — no formatting, no
   lookup, no lock, no ``inspect``, no thread scan, per line. When nothing is
   bound (the common case at startup) the tee pays a single ``is not None``
   test on a module global.

HOW THE IDENTITY TRAVELS
------------------------
``contextvars.ContextVar`` is the right primitive and ``threading.local`` is the
wrong one: ONE event-loop thread serves EVERY connected user, so a thread-local
would smear angela's identity over alice's coroutine. A ``ContextVar`` is scoped
to the asyncio task, which is exactly "one WebSocket connection / one request".
``asgiref``'s ``sync_to_async`` propagates the context into the worker thread,
so the whole synchronous Multi-Turn executor stays attributed for free.

Raw ``threading.Thread`` spawns (the self-healing watchdog, the Tier-2 reaper,
agent launchers) would otherwise start with an EMPTY context and lose the tag —
so ``install()`` also wraps ``Thread.start`` to run the thread body inside a
copy of the spawning context. That is precisely what asyncio and asgiref already
do; it is additive (a fresh thread has no context of its own to lose) and it is
what makes the attribution TOTAL instead of merely usual.

CONTRACT — do NOT weaken
------------------------
* **FAIL-OPEN, ALWAYS.** Every function swallows its own errors and degrades to
  "no tag". A logging decoration that can raise into a caller is infinitely
  worse than an untagged line — it could take down the chat path.
* **Stdlib only, and it imports nothing from ``agent.*``.** It is reachable from
  ``manage.py``'s tee, which runs BEFORE Django exists, and it must behave
  identically frozen and from source.
* **The tee is never imported by this module and this module is never imported
  by the tee.** Coupling is inverted: ``manage.py`` exposes an empty hook slot
  (``_USER_TAG_HOOK``) and ``install()`` fills it in when the Django app boots.
  A direct import either way would drag protobuf/gRPC (via ``agent/__init__``)
  into pre-Django startup, or hard-wire the tee to a module that may be absent.
* **ASCII only in the prefix.** The tee also writes to the Windows console,
  whose code page is cp1252; a non-ASCII prefix on the hot path is an encode
  error waiting to happen on every single line.

CONFIGURATION (``config.json``, all fail-open)
----------------------------------------------
``log_user_tags``               master switch, default ``true``
``log_user_tag_style``          ``"short"`` (default, ``[a3] ``) | ``"name"``
                                (``[angela#3] ``) | ``"off"``
``log_user_tag_thread_inherit`` default ``true`` — child threads inherit the tag
