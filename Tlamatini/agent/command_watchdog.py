"""
Autonomous command watchdog for Tlamatini.

Why this exists
---------------
A Multi-Turn tool call that shells out (``execute_command``, the Executer /
Pythonxer / PSer wrapped agents, ...) runs the child **synchronously on the
worker thread**. If that child wedges — the classic case is a malformed
``cmd /c "powershell -Command "...""`` whose mangled quotes drop PowerShell to
its ``>>`` continuation prompt where it sits forever waiting on stdin — the
worker thread blocks behind it and the whole chat appears "hanged".

The existing safety nets cannot rescue this situation:

  * ``tools._run_command_bounded`` starves stdin to DEVNULL and applies a hard
    600 s timeout, but (a) it only protects code paths that go through it, and
    (b) 600 s is a *very* long time to stare at a frozen chat.
  * ``orphan_reaper`` Tier 1 runs *after* each tool call returns — but a
    blocked tool call never returns, so Tier 1 never runs. Tier 2 runs *after*
    the answer is broadcast — which never happens while we are blocked.

Both of those run on the very thread that is stuck. This module closes the gap
with a process that **cannot itself be blocked by the hang**: a daemon thread,
started once at app boot, that periodically looks for console interpreters we
spawned (``cmd.exe`` / ``powershell.exe`` / ``pwsh.exe``) and kills only the
ones that are **making no progress at all**.

How "is it actually working?" is decided (the important part)
------------------------------------------------------------
The watchdog NEVER kills on elapsed time. A command may run for hours and is
perfectly safe as long as it is *making progress*. Progress is measured across
the **entire process subtree** (the shell PLUS every descendant), using two
independent signals sampled every tick:

  * **CPU time consumed** — ``cpu_times().user + .system`` summed over the
    subtree. A real build / pip install / compile / test run burns CPU.
  * **I/O bytes moved** — ``io_counters()`` read+write+other summed over the
    subtree. A download / ``git clone`` / large file write moves bytes even at
    ~0 % CPU.

A tick counts as "idle" ONLY if, since the previous tick, the subtree consumed
less than ``progress_cpu_seconds`` of CPU **and** moved less than
``progress_io_bytes`` of I/O. A process is killed only when it has been:

  * alive longer than ``hang_grace_seconds``, **and**
  * idle (by the subtree rule above) for ``required_idle_ticks`` *consecutive*
    ticks.

Consequences — why a long-but-working process is safe:

  * A CPU-bound job (any length) keeps incrementing CPU time → never idle.
  * An I/O-bound / network job (slow download, clone) keeps moving bytes →
    never idle, even though its own CPU is ~0 %.
  * A launcher shell whose *child* does the work (``cmd.exe`` → ``python.exe``)
    is judged by the SUBTREE, so the busy child keeps the whole tree "working".
  * A process we cannot sample at all (AccessDenied) is treated as *working*
    (fail safe — we never kill what we cannot measure).

Only a tree that burns no CPU and moves no bytes for the full grace+streak
window — the signature of a shell stuck at a prompt waiting on input that will
never come — is reaped.

Safety contract (mirrors ``orphan_reaper``)
-------------------------------------------
* The watchdog **must never raise** into anything — it runs on its own daemon
  thread and swallows every error.
* It hard-protects our own process, every ancestor PID, and the console-window
  owner — exactly the set ``orphan_reaper`` protects — so it can never close
  our own window or kill the terminal that launched us.
* It only ever kills a *console interpreter* (and that interpreter's
  descendants). It never touches the Python agent runtimes themselves, the
  Daphne worker, or the MCP/gRPC sidecar threads' processes.
* psutil missing → it degrades to a silent no-op.
