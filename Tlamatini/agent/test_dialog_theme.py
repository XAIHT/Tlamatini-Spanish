Tlamatini Author Banner - do not remove.

DIALOG STANDARDIZATION CONTRACT  (Angela, 2026-08-12)
=====================================================

Angela: "all of the dialogs ... they all are almost similar but there are a few
that doesn't, like the voice configuration, and it makes the user feel somehow
weird, like a not professional software."

Tlamatini used to ship FOUR unrelated dialog skins:

  1. the native modals  - External > MCPs (`emx-*`) and Contacts (`ctb-*`);
     this is the REFERENCE identity, the one in Angela's screenshot;
  2. the jQuery-UI family - Config / Tools / Skills / Access-Keys / canvas
     node dialogs: same two greys, but 12px corners, no border, a flat shadow,
     a grey title and centred grey buttons;
  3. the VOICE dialog (`.tlm-modal-*`) - #1b1e2b surface, gradient titlebar,
     no kicker, no footer bar, borderless 7px buttons;
  4. the Catalog of Prompts (`.modal-content`) - an 18px-radius card filled
     with a three-stop gradient.

`static/agent/css/dialog_theme.css` now defines the identity ONCE as custom
properties and makes every family wear it. These tests pin the parts that are
invisible to a screenshot and therefore easiest to break by accident:

  * the tokens still exist and still hold the reference values;
  * BOTH pages load the theme, and load it LAST (it wins on cascade ORDER, not
    specificity - move the <link> up and every dialog silently reverts);
  * the collected `staticfiles/` copy is in sync with the source (Angela's
    hot-swap rule: the served copy is the one that matters);
  * no stylesheet reintroduces one of the four dead skins;
  * the inline button style in JS still matches the CSS (inline wins, so a
    drift there re-breaks the footer no matter what the CSS says).

VISIBLE counterpart: `.claude/skills/tlamatini-daily-chat-test/harness/
dialog_theme_visible.py` opens every dialog in a headed Chrome, photographs it
with Shoter and compares the LIVE computed styles against the reference.
