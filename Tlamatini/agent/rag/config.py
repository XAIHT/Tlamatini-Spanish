# Conditional (feature-gated) rule blocks — weak-model legibility

# Two large, feature-specific rule blocks in prompt.pmt — the ACPX mechanics
# rule (Rule 12, ~1.8k words) and the Templates-directory rule (Rule 16) — are
# only meaningful when the matching tool surface is actually bound for the
# request. They are wrapped in plain HTML-comment sentinels so the prompt
# assembler can DROP them when their tools are absent, instead of asking a
# smaller model to read and obey instructions for tools it does not have.
#
# The markers are HTML comments (no curly braces) on purpose, so they never
# collide with the f-string template variables ({context}, {system_context},
# {self_knowledge}, …) nor with the brace-escaping in
# mcp_agent._build_system_prompt. Each marker pair may appear MORE THAN ONCE
# (the full Rule block AND its one-line Quick-Map pointer share the same pair),
# so resolution loops over every occurrence. A simple index walk is used (no
# regex backtracking over the very large ACPX block).
