"""Pins ANGELA'S Ask-Execs policy (2026-07-14).

She found that the "Ask Execs" toggle — which the toolbar and the docs promised
would confirm "every state-changing Tool/MCP/Agent" — actually gated ONLY the 15
command/script runners. So **Deleter could wipe a glob of files, and Whatsapper
could message a real human, with no prompt at all.**

Her decision, verbatim:

    "Implement A, B, D — not C! 'cause in the case of C I need the AI moves fast
     and they are operations of visible proceding: so don't make C set ask"

    A = destroys/overwrites data      (Deleter, Mover, File-Creator, Editor,
                                       De-Compresser, unzip_file, PDFer)
    B = reaches real people           (Emailer, Whatsapper, Telegrammer, Zavuerer)
    D = touches remote systems / net  (SCPer, Apirer, Nmapper, Discoverer, Crawler)

⚠️ SUPERSEDED — TIER B WAS REVERSED (Angela, 2026-07-26). Her words:

    "Messages must be able to be sent without asking,
     it depends only on AI desisicion."

Messaging is now the LLM's OWN judgement call: Emailer / Whatsapper / Telegrammer /
Zavuerer (and Instant Messaging Doctor, incl. retry_send) do NOT prompt. The gate is
therefore RUNNERS + A + D only. ``MESSAGING_UNGATED`` below is an ANTI-list — the test
asserts those names are ABSENT from the allowlist, so re-adding one "for safety" fails
loudly. Remaining safeguards on a send: the LLM's judgement, the Exec Report row, and
the user's Cancel. (Zavuerer also costs money per send — accepted, not overlooked.)
    C = desktop UI + hardware         (Keyboarder, Mouser, Windower, Playwrighter,
                                       STM32er, ESP32er, Arduiner, ESPHomer,
                                       Blenderer, Unrealer)  ← DELIBERATELY UNGATED

Tier C is NOT an oversight — it is a considered trade-off: those operations are
VISIBLE while they happen (you watch the pointer move, the window shift, the board
flash), so a confirmation prompt buys no safety and only costs speed.

These tests exist so a future refactor cannot silently (a) drop a destructive agent
out of the gate, or (b) bury her fast desktop agents behind a popup.
