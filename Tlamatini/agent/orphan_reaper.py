"""
Orphan-process reaper for Tlamatini.

Why this exists
---------------
On Windows, every console child that Tlamatini's agents launch can drag a
``conhost.exe`` companion alongside it. When the immediate parent dies
without first reaping its console children, those ``conhost.exe`` processes
linger as orphans — bearing the Tlamatini icon, since conhost inherits its
icon from the parent EXE that spawned it. Users see "Tlamatini" icons
floating in Task Manager hours after they closed the app and reasonably
conclude that Tlamatini is leaking processes (or worse, hiding a backdoor).

This module gives the rest of the codebase a single, idempotent way to
reap those orphans at three lifecycle points:

  1. **After each Multi-Turn tool call** (cheap, silent — Tier 1)
  2. **After the final answer is broadcast to the user** (Tier 2 — if
     anything survives, the consumer surfaces a SECOND chat message
     listing the offending name+PID pairs)
  3. **At Tlamatini.exe shutdown** (atexit / SIGINT / SIGBREAK — Tier 3)

What gets reaped
----------------
A process is considered a "Tlamatini orphan" if any of the following holds:

  * It is a descendant of the current Tlamatini process (recursive children
    of ``os.getpid()`` whose status is not RUNNING — i.e. zombie / dead).
  * It is a ``conhost.exe`` / ``openconsole.exe`` that is a *genuine orphan*
    — its owning parent process no longer exists (or is a dead/zombie
    remnant of something we spawned).
  * It is a process whose ``cmdline`` references the agent pool directory
    (``agents/pools/`` or ``agents/pools/_chat_runs_/``) yet is not tracked
    by ``AgentProcess`` or ``ChatAgentRun`` anymore.

What is NEVER reaped (the console-window safety contract)
---------------------------------------------------------
The console host that owns *our own* Tlamatini window is sacrosanct. Killing
it closes the visible console and strands the daphne server running headless
— users perceive this as "the window closed unexpectedly and the process
hung". So the reaper hard-protects:

  * the PID returned by ``GetConsoleWindow`` → ``GetWindowThreadProcessId``
    (the host of our own window),
  * ``os.getpid()`` and every ancestor PID (the terminal / PowerShell / cmd
    wrapper / PyInstaller bootloader / Explorer that launched us), and
  * any console host whose parent is still alive — i.e. one in active use.

Crucially, a ``conhost.exe`` whose parent PID is *ours* is our OWN window's
host and must be left alone — the previous revision reaped exactly this and
closed the window on every post-answer sweep in frozen (onedir) builds.

Public API
----------
``reap_orphans(scope, include_self_tree=True) -> ReapResult``
    Run a sweep and return a ReapResult with killed / surviving lists.

``format_survivors_message(survivors) -> str``
    Build the user-facing HTML snippet listing surviving (name, PID) pairs
    when Tier 2 detects un-killable processes.

Safety
------
Every external call is wrapped in try/except. The reaper MUST NEVER raise
into the caller — a cleanup that crashes the chat path is worse than the
orphans it tries to kill. On any unexpected error the offending entry is
simply skipped and recorded.

    The pool-cmdline sweep in ``reap_orphans`` kills any process whose
    cmdline references the agent-pool directory. That is correct for a real
    *orphan* (a pool process no record owns anymore) but catastrophic for a
    pool process that is deliberately STILL RUNNING. The media agents are
    the canonical case: **Talker / AudioPlayer / VideoPlayer block inside
    their ``main()`` until playback finishes** and can legitimately run for
    hours (a long Talker narration, a looped video). Those runs stay
    ``status='running'`` in ``ChatAgentRun`` (and canvas-launched pool
    agents are tracked in ``AgentProcess``) the whole time they play.

    Without this guard, the Tier-2 post-answer sweep fires the instant the
    Multi-Turn request finishes classifying the answer and reaps the running
    media agent — truncating the audio mid-sentence. That is exactly the bug
    this helper prevents: it returns the set of live, tracked PIDs so the
    caller can add them to ``protected_pids`` and let the playback run to its
    natural end.
