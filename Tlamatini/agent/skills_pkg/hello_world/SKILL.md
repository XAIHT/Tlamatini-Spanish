# Hello World

This skill exists to prove the SkillHarness pipeline is wired correctly.
It must:

1. Accept an optional `who` input (default: "world").
2. Return `{"greeting": "hello, <who>"}` exactly.

There are no side effects. There is no shell. There is no file IO.

If this skill cannot be invoked end-to-end, the SkillHarness is broken
and no other skill should be trusted. Treat that as the smoke-test gate.
