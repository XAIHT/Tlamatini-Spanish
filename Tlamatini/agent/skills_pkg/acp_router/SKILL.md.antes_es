# ACP Router

Route a plain-language request to the right ACPX harness.

## Decision rules

1. If the user's wording names a harness explicitly ("run this in Claude
   Code", "ask Cursor to..."), use that as `harness` directly.
2. If the user wants Codex chat conversation, prefer the native Codex
   binding (a separate skill); use ACPX Codex only when ACP/`/acp`/acpx
   is named explicitly or when background spawn is needed.
3. Default `mode` to `session` so follow-up turns can be added with
   `acp_send`. Use `one-shot` only when the user asked for a single
   non-interactive task. (Note: `mode` is ignored by `oneshot-prompt`
   transport agents — claude / cursor / gemini / qwen / codex — because
   each turn is its own fresh process. Continuity inside the child is
   not preserved between `acp_send` calls on those harnesses.)

## Transport awareness

The runtime now uses three transports. `acp_doctor` returns each agent's
transport in `details[].transport` (when populated by the host) or you
can infer from the `agent_id`:

- `oneshot-prompt` (**claude, cursor, gemini, qwen, codex**) — re-spawns
  the CLI fresh per turn with the prompt as a CLI argument
  (`claude -p "<task>"`, `codex exec "<task>"`, ...) and captures stdout
  to EOF. `acp_spawn` runs the first turn synchronously and returns the
  answer in the `events` array; the `assistant_message` event holds the
  captured stdout.
- `json-acp` (**tlamatini** self-host) — strict JSON envelope on stdin.
- `tui-repl` (**kiro, kimi, iflow, kilocode, opencode, pi, droid,
  copilot**) — long-lived REPL over stdin. `acp_spawn` returns the
  session_id sub-second; harvest answers via `acp_send_and_wait` /
  `acp_transcript`.

## Procedure

1. Call `list_acp_agents` to confirm the chosen agentId is `resolvable`.
   If not, call `acp_doctor` and surface the doctor message to the user.
2. Call `acp_spawn(agent_id=harness, task=<task>, cwd=<cwd>, mode=<mode>)`.
3. Return `{session_id, agent_id, transcript_path}` from the spawn result.

## Failure handling

- If `acp_spawn` returns `code: AGENT_NOT_FOUND`, do NOT silently fall
  back to a different harness. Report the missing CLI to the user, name
  the install instruction (e.g. "install the Claude Code CLI"), and ask
  whether they want to retry with a different harness.
- If `acp_spawn` returns `code: PERMISSION_DENIED`, the runtime is in
  `deny-all` mode. Report this to the user; do not try to bypass.
- If a `oneshot-prompt` spawn returns events with empty
  `assistant_message.text` and a `done._synthetic == "timeout"`, the CLI
  exceeded the default 180 s hard cap. Retry with explicit
  `timeout_seconds=300` if the task warrants it; otherwise report the
  timeout to the user.
