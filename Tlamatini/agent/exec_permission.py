"""Ask-Execs permission broker.

Bridges the **synchronous** Multi-Turn tool executor (which runs in a worker
thread via ``sync_to_async(ask_rag, thread_sensitive=False)``) with the
**asynchronous** WebSocket consumer, so the executor can BLOCK on a per-tool
permission prompt rendered in the browser before it runs a state-changing
Tool / MCP / Agent.

Flow:

1. The consumer creates one :class:`ExecPermissionBroker` per request and
   registers it under the user's id with :func:`register_broker`. Its
   ``emit`` callback schedules a WebSocket ``exec_permission_request`` frame
   onto the consumer's event loop (``asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe``).
2. The executor thread calls :meth:`ExecPermissionBroker.request_permission`
   with a detail dict. That emits the frame and BLOCKS on a
   :class:`threading.Event` until the browser answers, the request is
   cancelled, or the broker is closed.
3. The browser shows the modal dialog and sends back an
   ``exec-permission-response`` frame. The consumer routes it to
   :func:`resolve_permission`, which sets the event and unblocks the executor.

Safety contract (mirrors the orphan reaper's "never break the chat path"):

- Blocking is cancel-aware: it polls this run's cancellation latch on
  a short tick so a mid-flight Cancel never deadlocks the worker thread.
- If the emit itself fails (loop gone, socket closed), the request resolves to
  ``"deny"`` — when Ask Execs is on we must never run an unconfirmed
  state-changing tool just because the round-trip broke.
- :meth:`close` resolves every still-pending request to ``"deny"`` so a
  disconnect / request teardown can never leave the executor blocked forever.
