"""
Seed three Catalog-of-Prompts demos for **STM32F firmware programming** through
the wrapped **chat_agent_stm32er** Multi-Turn tool (the STM32 Template Project
MCP bridge). They run basic -> high complexity and showcase STM32er's full,
zero-config, fail-safe behavior:

    63  STM32 GENESIS         basic   bootstrap (STM32er DOWNLOADS + installs +
                                      validates the MCP itself) -> validate (full
                                      environment preflight) -> create_project ->
                                      build -> list_artifacts. NO board required.
    64  STM32 BLINKY          medium  validate -> create_project -> write_source
                                      (HAL GPIO blink main.c) -> build ->
                                      list_artifacts -> build_and_flash. The flash
                                      is board-OPTIONAL: the safety preflight
                                      refuses it cleanly if no ST-LINK is present.
    65  STM32 HIL OBSERVATORY  hard   validate (REQUIRES a connected board) ->
                                      create_project -> write_source (counter+UART
                                      firmware) -> build -> build_and_flash (REAL
                                      upload+verify) -> serial_session (VCP boot
                                      banner) -> live_monitor (sample g_blink_count
                                      from the RUNNING MCU over SWD) -> reset.
                                      Demo #3 USES THE HARDWARE end-to-end.

What changed vs. the first cut of these prompts: they now lead with STM32er's
**zero-config self-provisioning** (action='bootstrap' downloads the MCP from its
git repo and pip-installs/validates it — the user installs ONLY STM32CubeIDE) and
its **safety preflight** (action='validate' + the automatic pre-build/pre-flash
gate that validates the arm-none-eabi-gcc toolchain / STM32CubeIDE / programmer /
ST-LINK driver + probe / target device family, and REFUSES rather than producing
or flashing mis-targeted firmware). Compile-only actions need NO board; hardware
actions (flash/serial/SWD) require a positively-confirmed ST-LINK — so demo 63/64
run boardless and demo 65 drives a real STM32F407G-DISC1.

All three drive ONLY chat_agent_stm32er and remind the user to tick ONLY the
**Multi-Turn** checkbox (chat_agent_stm32er is NOT behind the ACPX/Skill surface,
so ACPX is not required — same as the Kalier 0099 and Unrealer 0100 demos).

Placement (append, no renumber)
-------------------------------
The catalog dropdown (static/agent/js/tools_dialog.js) enumerates promptName
'prompt-1','prompt-2',... and BREAKS at the first missing slot, so the catalog
must stay a contiguous, gap-free 'prompt-1..N'. Slots 1-62 are occupied (0100
appended the Unreal demos at 60-62); these three APPEND at 63-65 with no shift of
any existing prompt. Reverse deletes 63-65. (MAX_PROMPTS=100.)
