"""
Seed four fancy demo prompts that showcase the **Windower** (Win32 window
manager) and **Playwrighter** (scripted browser automation) agents from chat,
so the user can pick them from the Catalog of Prompts and watch each agent
*physically perform* on screen (a real window snapping/maximizing; a real
browser driving itself with headless=false).

Two prompts per agent — one basic, one medium:

    51  WINDOW SPOTLIGHT        Windower    basic   (focus+maximize+list+close)
    52  WINDOW CHOREOGRAPHY     Windower    medium  (restore->tile->move->list->close)
    53  BROWSER SPOTLIGHT       Playwrighter basic  (open example.com, extract+assert+shot)
    54  BROWSER WIZARD          Playwrighter medium (Wikipedia search: fill->click->wait->extract->assert->shot)

Placement (append, no renumber)
-------------------------------
The catalog dropdown (static/agent/js/tools_dialog.js::loadPrompts) enumerates
promptName 'prompt-1', 'prompt-2', ... and BREAKS at the first missing slot, so
the catalog must stay a contiguous, gap-free 'prompt-1..N'. Slots 1-50 are
fully occupied (0090 shifted the Multi-Turn/ACPX block down so the last demo is
the Gemini-pinned ACPX showcase at 50). These four demos therefore APPEND at the
tail (51-54) — contiguity is preserved with no shift of any existing prompt, so
no other Prompt row's idPrompt/promptName changes. Reverse simply deletes 51-54.

Unlike the 0090 Reviewer/Analyzer skill demos, these drive the **wrapped
chat_agent_windower / chat_agent_playwrighter tools**, which are NOT behind the
ACPX/Skill surface — so each prompt reminds the user to tick ONLY the
**Multi-Turn** checkbox (ACPX is not required). Windower is Windows-only (Win32);
Playwrighter needs Playwright installed (`pip install playwright && playwright
install`) and uses headless=false so the browser is visible.
