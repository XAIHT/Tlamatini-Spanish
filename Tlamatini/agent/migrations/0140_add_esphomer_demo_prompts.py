"""
Seed two Catalog-of-Prompts demos for **ESPHome device programming** through the
wrapped **chat_agent_esphomer** Multi-Turn tool (the `esphome` CLI bridge). They run
basic -> medium and mirror the ESP32er demos (0107), but built to ESPHomer's grain:
ESPHome devices are described in a SIMPLE YAML config (NO C++), ESPHomer drives the
`esphome` CLI DIRECTLY (no MCP server), and "provisioning" means pip-installing
ESPHome itself.

    79  ESPHOME GENESIS   basic   bootstrap (ESPHomer pip-installs + validates ESPHome
                                  itself) -> validate (full environment preflight) ->
                                  new_config (GENERATE a device YAML) -> config
                                  (validate the YAML) -> compile -> list_artifacts.
                                  NO board required (pure provision + build).
    80  SMART LIGHT       medium  validate -> new_config (a phone-controlled on/off
                                  light on the onboard LED) -> config -> compile ->
                                  list_artifacts -> upload. The upload is board-OPTIONAL:
                                  ESPHomer's safety preflight refuses it cleanly with
                                  'No serial port detected' if no board is attached
                                  (expected + routable, not a crash).

Both drive ONLY chat_agent_esphomer and remind the user to tick ONLY the **Multi-Turn**
checkbox (chat_agent_esphomer is NOT behind the ACPX/Skill surface, so ACPX is not
required — same as the ESP32er 0107, STM32er 0103 demos).

Placement (append, no renumber)
-------------------------------
The catalog dropdown (static/agent/js/tools_dialog.js) enumerates promptName
'prompt-1','prompt-2',... and BREAKS at the first missing slot, so the catalog must
stay a contiguous, gap-free 'prompt-1..N'. Slots 1-78 are occupied (0137 appended the
Globber demo at 78); these two APPEND at 79-80 with no shift of any existing prompt.
Reverse deletes 79-80. (MAX_PROMPTS=100.)
