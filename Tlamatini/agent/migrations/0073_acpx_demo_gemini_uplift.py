"""
ACPX demo prompts uplift — Gemini-led, more visually rimbombante.

Seeds seven NEW prompts in idPrompt slots 42-48 — the louder, Gemini-pinned
companions to the rich-HTML ACPX demos that 0072 placed at 36-41 and the
simplified plain-text demos that 0074 placed at 29-35. These do NOT
overwrite any earlier slot; each prior migration keeps the prompts it
originally populated. Order inside the group follows the same Health
Parade → Skill Catalog → Permission Gate → End-to-End Pipeline → ACPX
Auditor → Multi-CLI Relay → Gemini Live Reasoning learning progression
used by the simplified and rich-HTML siblings. The brand-new "Gemini Live
Reasoning Showcase" lands last (idPrompt 48) because it requires a real
GEMINI_API_KEY and three live multi-turn reasoning rounds — the most
configuration-heavy demo in the entire catalog.

Uses update_or_create so reruns are idempotent.
