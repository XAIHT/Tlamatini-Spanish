"""
Seed three Catalog-of-Prompts demos that exercise the **extended** Unreal MCP
command surface — the System / Level / Asset / Material categories plus
``take_screenshot`` — none of which the original Unrealer demo (idPrompt 25,
migration 0087) touches. 0087 drives editor / blueprint / node / umg only; these
three drive the rest, at basic / medium / hard complexity:

    60  UNREAL SNAPSHOT          basic     get_current_level -> spawn_actor ->
                                           take_screenshot -> save_current_level
                                           (the observe->act loop, shortest new win)
    61  UNREAL SCENE FORGE       medium    get_current_level -> list_assets ->
                                           create_folder -> create_material ->
                                           create_material_instance ->
                                           set_material_parameter -> spawn_actor ->
                                           assign_material -> take_screenshot ->
                                           save_current_level (content authoring)
    62  UNREAL PYTHON & INTROSPECT  hard   execute_console_command (via the agent's
                                           console_command remap) -> get_class_info ->
                                           list_assets -> execute_python (the universal
                                           in-editor escape hatch, multi-line code passed
                                           as a triple-quoted params.code) -> take_screenshot

All three drive the wrapped **chat_agent_unrealer** Multi-Turn tool, exactly like
idPrompt 25. They are deliberately runnable against the same live editor: each opens
with the preconditions (UE5 open in dev mode, the Unreal MCP plugin's TCP listener
bound to 127.0.0.1:55557) and reminds the user to tick ONLY the **Multi-Turn**
checkbox — chat_agent_unrealer is NOT behind the ACPX / Skill surface, so ACPX is not
required (same as the Kalier 0099 and Windower 0095/0096 demos).

Placement (append, no renumber)
-------------------------------
The catalog dropdown (static/agent/js/tools_dialog.js::loadPrompts) enumerates
promptName 'prompt-1', 'prompt-2', ... and BREAKS at the first missing slot, so the
catalog must stay a contiguous, gap-free 'prompt-1..N'. Slots 1-59 are fully occupied
(0099 appended the three KALI demos at 57-59). These three therefore APPEND at the tail
(60-62) — contiguity is preserved with no shift of any existing prompt, so no other
Prompt row's idPrompt/promptName changes. Reverse simply deletes 60-62.
(MAX_PROMPTS=100, so there is ample room.)

Honesty note baked into the prompts: a freshly-created (blank) Material declares no
named parameters, so ``set_material_parameter`` may legitimately return status='error'
("parameter not found"). Demo 61 records that verbatim and continues — the goal is to
show the full Material command surface and its real failure modes, mirroring how the
0087 demo treats a meshless spawn as "expected, not a failure".
