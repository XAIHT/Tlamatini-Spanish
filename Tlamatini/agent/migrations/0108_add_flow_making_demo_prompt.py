Seed one Catalog-of-Prompts demo for the **flow-making** skill — turning a plain
objective into a downloadable, canvas-loadable `.flw` by driving the FlowCreator
engine (full 83-agent catalog) end-to-end from chat, through `invoke_skill`.

    69  ALARM FLOW FORGE   builds `alarm_every_3_hours.flw` (a recurring
                           "every 3 hours, Telegram me that another 3-hour lap
                           passed" workflow) and saves it to the user's Desktop
                           Flows folder. ONE invoke_skill('flow-making', ...) call.

Why this prompt is phrased around `invoke_skill` (not just "create a flow"):
- `list_skills` / `invoke_skill` are ACPX-surface tools (`agent.acpx.ACPX_TOOL_NAMES`);
  with the ACPX toolbar toggle OFF they are filtered out and the skill is invisible.
- The catalog auto-sets the toolbar toggles from the prompt text via
  `tools_dialog.js::classifyPromptModes` — which tags a prompt **ACPX** (⇒ also
  Multi-Turn) only when it literally mentions `invoke_skill` / `list_skills` /
  an `acp_*` tool. Naming `invoke_skill` here makes the catalog click auto-enable
  BOTH **Multi-Turn** and **ACPX**, and pushes the planner to select `invoke_skill`.

Placement (append, no renumber)
-------------------------------
The catalog dropdown (static/agent/js/tools_dialog.js) enumerates promptName
'prompt-1','prompt-2',... and BREAKS at the first missing slot, so the catalog
must stay a contiguous, gap-free 'prompt-1..N'. Slots 1-68 are occupied (0107
appended the ESP32er demos at 66-68); this APPENDS at 69 with no shift of any
existing prompt. Reverse deletes 69. (MAX_PROMPTS=100.)
