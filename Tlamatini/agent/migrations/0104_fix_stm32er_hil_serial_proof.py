"""
Fix the **STM32 HIL OBSERVATORY** demo (catalog prompt #65, seeded by 0103).

WHY
---
Live run on a real STM32F407G-DISC1 exposed a board-specific flaw in the demo as
first written. The board flashed cleanly (green LED blinking) and the firmware
WAS running — proven by ``live_monitor`` reading ``g_blink_count`` climbing over
SWD (30 -> 31 -> 32). But the demo made the **serial VCP boot-banner read** a
PRIMARY proof step, and that read returns 0 bytes forever on this board:

    On the STM32F4-Discovery family (including the STM32F407G-DISC1) the on-board
    ST-LINK does NOT bridge its Virtual COM Port to the MCU's USART pins (unlike
    ST Nucleo boards, which route VCP <-> USART2 / PA2-PA3). A firmware that
    transmits on USART2 therefore produces NOTHING on the VCP, no matter the
    baud or timeout.

Because the demo gave the model no "empty VCP read is EXPECTED here, do NOT
retry" guidance, it thrashed: ~6 ``serial_session`` retries with escalating
timeouts (5/6/8/10/12 s, even injecting ``data='\\n'``), plus ``serial_connect``
+ ``serial_read`` + a stray ``reset`` — 21 STM32er calls for what should be ~9.

THE FIX (this migration rewrites prompt #65 only)
-------------------------------------------------
1. **live SWD memory (``live_monitor``) is now the PRIMARY, authoritative HIL
   proof** (it works on every ST-LINK board). It runs as Step 6, before serial.
2. **The serial VCP read is now best-effort, board-aware, and AT-MOST-ONCE.** The
   prompt states the F4-Discovery VCP-not-routed fact up front, tells the model an
   empty read (bytes=0) is the EXPECTED outcome on this board, and forbids the
   retry / connect-read loop. (Real UART would need an external USB-TTL adapter on
   PA2/PA3 — out of scope for an ST-LINK-only demo.)
3. **The "SILICON VERIFIED" verdict is re-keyed on build + flash + live_memory.**
   Serial is a bonus chip (green = data, amber = expected-empty, red = real connect
   error), never a gate, so the demo reaches a clean success on a Discovery board.

This is a content-only update of one ``Prompt`` row via ``update_or_create`` —
no schema change. Reverse restores the original 0103 text verbatim.
