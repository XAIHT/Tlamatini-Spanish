"""
Plain-text-only versions of the seven ACPX demos. The rich-HTML siblings
in 0072 (idPrompt 36-41) and 0073 (idPrompt 42-48) embed literal banner
blocks (<div style='...'>...) into the prompt text so the LLM would
mimic them; in practice that HTML leaks into the chat-message input box
and the user-message bubble in the chat history as raw, unreadable noise.

This migration adds short, readable paragraph versions (10-20 seconds
to scan) at slots idPrompt 29-35 — the FIRST ACPX block in the catalog,
ahead of the rich-HTML (36-41) and Gemini-pinned (42-48) blocks, because
"plain-text only, works against ANY resolvable agent_id, no API key
pin" is the lowest-complexity ACPX entry point. The LLM is still told
to render its OUTPUT with banners and tables (the chat output supports
HTML); only the *prompt text the user sends* is now plain-text-only.

Order within the group follows the same Health Parade → Skill Catalog →
Permission Gate → End-to-End Pipeline → ACPX Auditor → Multi-CLI Relay →
Gemini Live Reasoning learning progression used by the two sibling groups.

idempotent via update_or_create.
