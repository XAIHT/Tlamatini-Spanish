"""
Seed two ADVANCED demo prompts that go beyond the basic/medium Windower &
Playwrighter showcases (0095) by conducting several desktop-UI / browser agents
together in one flow — far more *visual*: a real window is staged, clicked into
with the mouse and typed into with the keyboard before it dances around the
screen; a real browser types a query key-by-key, submits with the Enter key,
scrolls with the keyboard and captures three staged screenshots.

    55  DESKTOP DIRECTOR    Windower+Mouser+Keyboarder   advanced
                            (stage -> mouse-click-to-focus -> live keyboard typing
                             -> tile/maximize/restore/pin choreography -> list -> close)
    56  BROWSER VIRTUOSO    Playwrighter                 advanced
                            (visible per-key typing -> Enter-key submit -> article
                             -> attribute extract -> keyboard scroll -> 3 screenshots)

Placement (append, no renumber)
-------------------------------
The catalog dropdown (static/agent/js/tools_dialog.js::loadPrompts) enumerates
promptName 'prompt-1', 'prompt-2', ... and BREAKS at the first missing slot, so
the catalog must stay a contiguous, gap-free 'prompt-1..N'. Slots 1-54 are fully
occupied (0095 appended the four desktop/browser demos at 51-54). These two demos
therefore APPEND at the tail (55-56) — contiguity is preserved with no shift of
any existing prompt, so no other Prompt row's idPrompt/promptName changes.
Reverse simply deletes 55-56. (MAX_PROMPTS=100, so there is ample room.)

Like 0095 (and unlike the 0090 Reviewer/Analyzer skill demos), these drive the
wrapped chat_agent_* tools, which are NOT behind the ACPX/Skill surface — so each
prompt reminds the user to tick ONLY the **Multi-Turn** checkbox (ACPX is not
required). DESKTOP DIRECTOR is Windows-only (Win32 + PyAutoGUI). BROWSER VIRTUOSO
needs Playwright installed (`pip install playwright && playwright install`) and
uses headless=false so the browser is visible.

    "fully-visible showcase that conducts the WHOLE desktop-UI trio in one flow: "
    "the **Windower** agent stages and moves a real window, the **Mouser** agent "
    "clicks into it to place the caret, and the **Keyboarder** agent types live "
    "text into it &mdash; then Windower makes the now-text-filled window dance "
    "around the screen. All driven from chat through the wrapped "
