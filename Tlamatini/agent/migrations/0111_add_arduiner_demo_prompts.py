"""
Seed three Catalog-of-Prompts demos for **Arduino firmware programming** through
the wrapped **chat_agent_arduiner** Multi-Turn tool (the Arduino CLI / `arduino-cli`
bridge). They run basic -> high complexity and mirror the ESP32er demos (0107) and
STM32er demos (0103), but built to Arduiner's grain: Arduiner drives the
`arduino-cli` binary DIRECTLY (no MCP server), the microcontroller is chosen by the
**FQBN** (e.g. arduino:avr:uno), "provisioning" means auto-downloading the
arduino-cli binary AND auto-installing the board's core, the project is a plain
Arduino sketch scaffolded from the bundled **ArduinoTemplateProject**, and the
firmware is Arduino-core C++ (.ino):

    70  ARDUINO GENESIS        basic   bootstrap (Arduiner DOWNLOADS + installs +
                                       validates the arduino-cli binary itself) ->
                                       validate -> create_project (from the bundled
                                       ArduinoTemplateProject) -> write_source (blink
                                       .ino) -> build (auto-installs arduino:avr) ->
                                       list_artifacts. NO board required.
    71  ARDUINO BLINKY         medium  validate -> create_project -> write_source
                                       (pin-13 blink + Serial prints) -> build ->
                                       list_artifacts -> build_and_upload. The upload
                                       is board-OPTIONAL: Arduiner's safety preflight
                                       refuses it cleanly with 'No serial port
                                       detected' if no board is attached (expected +
                                       routable, not a crash).
    72  ARDUINO HIL OBSERVATORY  hard  validate (REQUIRES a connected serial port)
                                       -> device_list -> create_project ->
                                       write_source (counter firmware that prints
                                       'BOOT tlamatini arduino count=<n>' over Serial)
                                       -> build -> build_and_upload (REAL flash over
                                       USB-serial) -> monitor (read the RUNNING
                                       board's serial stream and watch the counter
                                       climb). Demo #3 UPLOADS TO AND OBSERVES THE
                                       HARDWARE end-to-end.

Arduino hardware nuance baked into demo #72: a classic Arduino (Uno/Nano/Mega)
flashes over its USB-serial bridge (ATmega16U2 / CH340 / FTDI), and that SAME port
carries the firmware's `Serial.print` output — so, like the ESP32 (and unlike the
STM32F4-Discovery whose ST-LINK VCP is not routed to the MCU USART, see 0104), the
serial monitor reads the firmware output natively with NO extra wiring. The serial
`monitor` is therefore the authoritative hardware-in-the-loop proof here.

All three drive ONLY chat_agent_arduiner and remind the user to tick ONLY the
**Multi-Turn** checkbox (chat_agent_arduiner is NOT behind the ACPX/Skill surface,
so ACPX is not required — same as the ESP32er 0107, STM32er 0103, Kalier 0099 demos).

Placement (append, no renumber)
-------------------------------
The catalog dropdown (static/agent/js/tools_dialog.js) enumerates promptName
'prompt-1','prompt-2',... and BREAKS at the first missing slot, so the catalog must
stay a contiguous, gap-free 'prompt-1..N'. Slots 1-69 are occupied (0108 appended
the flow-making demo at 69); these three APPEND at 70-72 with no shift of any
existing prompt. Reverse deletes 70-72. (MAX_PROMPTS=100.)
