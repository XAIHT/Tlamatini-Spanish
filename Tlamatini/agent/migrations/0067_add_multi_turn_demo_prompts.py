"""
Originally seeded three multi-turn demo prompts (local document demo, web
research demo, monitoring demo) at idPrompt 28-30. Those three prompts are
near-verbatim copies of the same three demos already populated by 0002 at
idPrompt 20-22 (the only meaningful difference was that 0002's versions
keep the "Tlamatini, ..." prefix that matches the chat's identity rules).

Keeping both copies left two parallel groups of multi-turn demos in the
catalog, so this migration is now a no-op for the Prompt table: the
multi-turn demo group is owned solely by 0002 at 20-22.

The migration file is preserved as a noop so the migration history (and
the dependency edge from 0066 to 0072) stays unchanged.
