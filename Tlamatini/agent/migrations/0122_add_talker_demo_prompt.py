"""
Seed a Catalog-of-Prompts demo for **Talker** — Tlamatini's TEXT-TO-SPEECH — run
through the wrapped **chat_agent_talker** Multi-Turn tool. This is the MANDATORY
catalog prompt every Multi-Turn-capable agent must ship (CLAUDE.md ⚠️ directive /
create_new_agent.md Step 7.8 / tlamatini-agent-creation skill Phase 19); Talker
(#75, migrations 0120/0121) shipped without one, so this closes that gap.

    73  TLAMATINI SPEAKS   basic   speak a greeting with voice='tara' -> speak a
                                   second line with voice='leah' -> report a small
                                   table of each call's voice/status/seconds/path.

FEMALE VOICE ONLY by design: Tlamatini is female, so the demo uses ONLY her
permitted female voices (tara/leah/jess/mia/zoe). Talker enforces this itself —
a non-female voice makes it close its execution entirely (see prompt.pmt Rule 17
and talker.py::resolve_voice) — so the demo never asks for anything else.

SAFE to run repeatedly (the daily chat test may execute it): TTS is
observational/output (it plays + saves a WAV), it mutates no persistent state,
and it is NOT in the Exec Report. Audible sound needs snac+torch + a reachable
Ollama serving the Orpheus model; without them Talker still runs and reports
status `tokens_only` (a documented degraded mode, NOT a failure).

Placement (append, no renumber)
-------------------------------
The catalog dropdown (static/agent/js/tools_dialog.js) enumerates promptName
'prompt-1','prompt-2',... and BREAKS at the first missing slot, so the catalog
must stay a contiguous, gap-free 'prompt-1..N'. Slots 1-72 are occupied (0111
appended the Arduiner demos at 70-72); this APPENDS at 73 with no shift of any
existing prompt. Reverse deletes 73. (MAX_PROMPTS=100.)
