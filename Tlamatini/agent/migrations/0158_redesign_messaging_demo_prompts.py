# REDESIGN of the messaging demo prompts (Telegrammer + Whatsapper).
#
# The first version hardcoded `contact_name='me'`, which confused users: they
# edited the story ("send to Cosapi") but the actual recipient stayed 'me', so
# the message went to themselves. These rewrites put a CLEAR, fill-in-the-blank
# [[ ... ]] placeholder for the TARGET CONTACT NAME, and state plainly that the
# name must already be saved in the contacts book (contacts.json).
#
# Style mirrors the proven 0155 contact-scaffold prompt: while the [[ ... ]]
# brackets are still present (unfilled), the agent STOPS and sends nothing — so
# these remain SAFE for the daily chat regression. [[ ]] (no angle brackets) so
# an HTML card preview can't eat the markers.
