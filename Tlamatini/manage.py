    """Duplicates writes to the original console stream and a log file.

    Both sinks are written defensively: if the console window is closed
    (or its handle otherwise becomes invalid), writing to ``self._original``
    can raise OSError. We MUST swallow that — an exception escaping a
    logging call on a background thread can wedge that thread and make the
    server appear hung even though the console is merely gone. The log
    file is the durable record either way.

    Buffered flush policy (speed batch, 2026-07-02): the log-file ``write``
    itself stays per-call (it only fills the file object's internal buffer,
    which is cheap), but the EXPENSIVE ``flush()`` — an OS-level write that
    used to run on every single line and serialized every thread on file
    I/O — is now deferred. The log file is flushed when ANY of these hold:

      * ~8 KB accumulated since the last flush, or
      * >= 1 second passed since the last flush, or
      * the chunk carries an urgent marker (ERROR / Traceback / Exception /
        CRITICAL / FATAL / '!!!' / '❌' / '⛔') — errors must be readable in
        ``tlamatini.log`` IMMEDIATELY, never sitting in a buffer, or
      * somebody calls ``flush()`` explicitly (``print(..., flush=True)``), or
      * process exit / quiet period — ``_setup_log_tee`` registers an atexit
        flush AND a 1-second idle-flusher daemon thread, so the file never
        lags more than ~1 s behind even when the app goes silent mid-burst.

    ``_LOG_LOCK`` is a CLASS-level lock shared by the stdout and stderr tees
    (they write the SAME file handle), so concurrent writes from different
    threads/streams cannot interleave mid-chunk.
