ASK-EXECS REGRESSION SUITE — the Proceed/Deny permission scheme, end to end.
===========================================================================

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
--------------------
Angela, 2026-07-14, live on the frozen build:

    "I had to push in Deny, 'cause the denial was already done."

She cancelled a Multi-Turn run while a Proceed/Deny prompt was open. The backend
denied it and stopped the run correctly — but the MODAL STAYED ON HER SCREEN and
she was forced to answer a question that had already been answered. At that time
the dialog was `modal:true`, used `closeOnEscape:false`, and hid its titlebar X,
so clicking a button was her ONLY way out. An ORPHAN MODAL. Since v1.48.17,
Escape routes through the same Deny/dismiss path as the dialog's own close action.

Fixing that exposed two more:
  * a Cancel was reported (and SAVED to chat history) as "⛔ You denied the Tool…"
    — a decision she never made;
  * closing the tab while a prompt was open parked the executor thread FOREVER.

This suite locks all of that down, and is written to be READ AND EDITED BY ANGELA.


HOW TO RUN (visible, headed — headless is forbidden in this project)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
    python ask_execs_regression.py --base http://127.0.0.1:8100
    python ask_execs_regression.py --only S3            # just one scenario
    python ask_execs_regression.py --only S1,S3,S6      # a few
    python ask_execs_regression.py --list               # show the matrix and exit

It asks for the password in the console (getpass) — it is never stored, never put
on a command line, never printed.


HOW TO ADD A SCENARIO (this is the part you'll want)
----------------------------------------------------
1. Write a function `def s10_my_thing(page): ...`
2. Use the helpers: `send`, `wait_prompt`, `click_proceed`, `click_deny`,
   `cancel_run`, `prompt_open`, `wait_idle`, `answer_text`, `shot`, `check`.
3. Register it in SCENARIOS below with an id and a one-line description.
That's it — `--only` and the report pick it up automatically.


WHAT ACTUALLY PROMPTS  (read this before writing a scenario!)
-------------------------------------------------------------
Ask-Execs prompts only for the tools in `mcp_agent.py::_ASK_EXECS_REQUIRED_TOOLS`.
Angela's policy (2026-07-14) — she chose tiers A + B + D, and deliberately NOT C:

  PROMPTS (ask first):
    * command / script runners — Executer, Pythonxer, SSHer, Kalier, Dockerer,
      Kuberneter, SQLer, Mongoxer, Gitter, Jenkinser, PSer, J-Decompiler
    * A  destroys/overwrites data — Deleter, Mover, File-Creator, Editor,
         De-Compresser, unzip_file
    * B  reaches real people      — Emailer, Whatsapper, Telegrammer, Zavuerer
    * D  remote systems / network — SCPer, Apirer, Nmapper, Discoverer, Crawler

  NEVER PROMPTS (on purpose):
    * C  desktop UI + hardware — Keyboarder, Mouser, Windower, Playwrighter,
         STM32er, ESP32er, Arduiner, ESPHomer, Blenderer, Unrealer.
         Angela: "I need the AI moves fast and they are operations of visible
         proceding" — you SEE them happen, so a prompt buys nothing.
    * read-only / observational tools, the management-polling helpers, crypto,
      and invoke_skill.

==> The scenarios below drive `chat_agent_executer` because it is the simplest
    gated tool with a checkable side effect (an echo).
==> If you write a scenario for a TIER-C agent, NO PROMPT WILL EVER APPEAR and it
    will hang — that is correct behaviour, not a bug.
==> The gate itself is pinned by `agent/test_ask_execs_allowlist.py`.
