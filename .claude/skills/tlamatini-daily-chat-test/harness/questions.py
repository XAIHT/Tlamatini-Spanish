"""
Question bank generator for the Tlamatini daily chat test.

Produces EXACTLY 1000 questions, deterministically (stable order + stable ids),
so successive daily runs are comparable.

SAFETY CONTRACT
---------------
The run mode the user pinned is Multi-Turn ON, which makes Tlamatini an
*operator* -- it will REALLY execute tools. Therefore every question in this
bank is curated to be SAFE TO EXECUTE 1000x/day on the developer's own machine:

  * knowledge / introspection  -> the LLM mostly answers directly
  * self-knowledge             -> describes Tlamatini itself
  * benign read-only ops       -> get time, git *status/log*, read a few lines,
                                  search the codebase, system metrics, dir list
  * general IT/programming Q&A  -> answered directly, no side effects

It deliberately contains NO destructive prompts: nothing deletes/moves/writes
files, formats, kills processes, scans third-party hosts, sends messages, spawns
GUIs in bulk, or mutates remote state. ACPX/skill *execution* is excluded too
(ACPX is OFF for this run, so acp_* tools are filtered out) -- ACPX shows up only
as knowledge questions.

Each question is a dict:
    {
        "id":       "Q0001",
        "category": "agent-knowledge",
        "text":     "...",
        "expect":   ["keyword", ...],   # heuristic hint (>=1 expected, optional)
        "min_len":  40,                  # heuristic min answer length
    }
