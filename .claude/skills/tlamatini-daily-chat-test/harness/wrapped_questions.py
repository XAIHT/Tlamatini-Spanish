"""
One functional question per WRAPPED chat-agent in Tlamatini.

Source of truth: agent/chat_agent_registry.py :: WRAPPED_CHAT_AGENT_SPECS
(49 wrapped agents as of 2026-06-05). Each question is an OPERATOR prompt
(Multi-Turn ON) that exercises that agent's actual functionality. The
send_email agent additionally carries a second question that exercises the
file-attachment path (email.attachments), so the bank is 50 questions.

Safety choices (this runs for real):
  * file ops act on THROWAWAY files the question first creates, under the app
    Temp dir -- nothing pre-existing is moved/deleted.
  * crypto does a self-contained round-trip (keygen -> cipher -> decipher).
  * external / infra agents (ssh, scp, sql, mongo, docker, k8s, jenkins, email,
    telegram, whatsapp, imap, kali, unreal) target localhost / sanctioned hosts
    or are told to "report the result if it can't connect" -- a graceful failure
    is a valid exercise of the agent's launch + report path. The email
    attachment test points at smtp.example.com (no real delivery) and attaches
    a THROWAWAY file it first creates under the app Temp dir.
  * desktop agents use their least-disruptive real action (windower=list,
    mouser=move-no-click, shoter/camcorder/recorder=capture).
  * firmware agents (stm32er/esp32er/arduiner) use their lightest meta action;
    NOTE they may trigger a one-time toolchain bootstrap download -- they are
    ordered LAST so the rest finish first.

Same dict shape as questions.py so run_test.py can consume either bank.
