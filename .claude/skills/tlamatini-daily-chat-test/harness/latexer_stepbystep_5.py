"""
Tlamatini - VISIBLE (headed Chrome) end-to-end test of FIVE escalating
LaTeXer STEP-BY-STEP wizards, with a TRUTH ORACLE over the Exec Report.

ANGELA'S MAIN GOAL (2026-08-06), and the only thing this test really judges:

    The final EXECUTION TABLES must show the TRUE verdict.
    Never a FAILED for something that really worked.
    Never a SUCCESS for something that really failed.

So "the wizard finished" is NOT a pass here. For every scenario the harness
establishes GROUND TRUTH INDEPENDENTLY OF THE TABLE - by looking at the real
filesystem (did the PDF actually appear? does the .tex really contain the
user's equation?) - and then compares that truth against what the Exec Report
printed. A mismatch is reported as exactly one of:

    FALSE_FAILURE  - the table said FAILURE but the work really happened
    FALSE_SUCCESS  - the table said SUCCESS but the work really did not happen

Scenario 5 deliberately contains ONE of each direction so the test can prove
both halves rather than only the one that happened to regress:

    * a lint of a KNOWINGLY BROKEN file  -> the linter does its job -> SUCCESS
    * a compile of a FILE THAT DOES NOT EXIST -> nothing is produced -> FAILURE

Escalation:
    L1 first_light   trivial   no user data
    L2 anatomy       easy      no user data
    L3 integral_1    medium    USER supplies an integral (Angela's shape)
    L4 integral_hard hard      USER supplies Angela's exact expression
    L5 project_xt    extreme   multi-file project + BOTH verdict probes

Screenshots are taken by SHOTER, Tlamatini's own agent (PIL is FORBIDDEN).
The browser is ALWAYS headed - run_test.Harness refuses headless.
