# Tlamatini — Multi-Turn Mode, Create Flow, Parametrizer Sections

## Multi-Turn Mode

When **Multi-Turn is checked** in the toolbar:
1. Prompt-shape validation is skipped
2. Request-scoped global execution plan/DAG is built
3. MCP contexts are prefetched selectively
4. **The FULL enabled surface is bound** (see *Multi-Turn now binds the full surface* below) — every enabled tool/agent/skill, ACPX still filtered by its checkbox. *(Superseded 2026-06: the planner used to bind only a ≤20-tool subset via `max_selected_tools`; that starved the operator. The planner still runs for capability hints/ordering, but no longer DROPS a tool from the bind.)*
5. Wrapped agents launch in headless/background mode
6. The MultiTurnToolAgentExecutor **deduplicates wrapped chat-agent calls** with identical arguments (prevents the LLM from launching the same sub-agent twice in a single request)
7. After the final answer, the frontend renders a **"Create Flow"** button whenever **at least one agent executed successfully** during the request; it converts **only the successfully-executed** tool calls into a downloadable `.flw` workflow (the failed executions are dropped). *(There is no whole-answer SUCCESS/FAILURE classifier — the old `services/answer_analizer.py` was removed 2026-07-06.)*
8. **Every model step is self-healed.** Each `llm.invoke()` in the executor is wrapped by a per-request `SelfHealingInvoker` (`agent/self_healing.py`) that retries distinct recovery tactics under a per-attempt watchdog, so a transient model failure never hangs, never discards work already done, and never yields a silent/untruthful answer (see *Self-healing model steps* below).

When **unchecked**: legacy one-shot behavior is preserved exactly.

The toggle is per-browser-session, sent as `multi_turn_enabled` with each request.

### Short Follow-Up Message Scoring

`global_execution_planner._select_planner_tool_names()` accepts a `chat_history_text` argument. When the current request is a short follow-up (≤4 meaningful tokens, e.g. "continue", "go ahead"), it boosts each capability's score with up to +15 points derived from the last 4 chat messages. This keeps tool context from evaporating on terse follow-ups and is wired in `rag/factory.py::_extract_chat_history_text()`.

## Self-healing model steps (2026-07-06)

Every model call inside the Multi-Turn executor — `MultiTurnToolAgentExecutor` in `mcp_agent.py` — is routed through a per-request **`SelfHealingInvoker`** (`agent/self_healing.py`), not a bare `llm.invoke()`. The wrapped steps are: the no-tools direct answer, **each** tool-loop iteration, the repetition-breaker nudge/summarize retry, and the final wrap-up. Its contract is three promises — **never hang, never discard work, never lie**:

- **Never hang.** Each attempt runs under a watchdog (`_run_with_watchdog`, on a worker thread) of `unified_agent_llm_step_timeout_seconds` (default **80 s**); a call that does not answer by the deadline is ABANDONED, never waited on. On a transient failure she keeps trying DISTINCT tactics — plain retry, back-off sleep, message-tail trim (`trim_messages`), plain-LLM fallback — up to `unified_agent_llm_step_max_tactics` (default **4096**). **Only the USER (Cancel)** or a fully-exhausted tactic ladder stops her; then `ModelStepUnrecoverable(reason, attempts, tactics_tried)` is raised.
- **Never discard work (graceful degradation).** If `ModelStepUnrecoverable` fires after ≥1 agent already ran, the executor finishes GRACEFULLY from that real work (`_degraded_answer_from_results`) so the Create-Flow button and Exec report survive and the answer is truthful. Only a pure-Q&A with no work to preserve re-raises — and `rag/chains/unified.py::_invoke_unified_agent_with_retry` then short-circuits it straight to the fallback instead of re-running the whole expensive executor ladder.
- **Never lie.** `recovery_preamble(healer.recovery_events)` is prepended to the FINAL, persisted answer on every exit path (they all funnel through `_build_result_dict`), so the user is always told what Tlamatini went through — never a silent stall or a lying "no tools ran".

**Live status.** While she retries, `register_status_broadcaster` (wired in `consumers.py` for every Multi-Turn request, independent of Ask-Execs, keyed by the same user id, torn down in a `finally`) pushes `agent_message` frames to THIS user's chat so the retries are visible. `mcp_agent.py` now ALWAYS forwards `executor_payload["ask_execs_user_id"]` (previously only under Ask-Execs) so the healer has a user id to emit to.

**Frontend: those status lines must NOT re-enable the controls (2026-07-07).** The status frames are shaped exactly like the final answer, so the browser must not treat one as "done". `agent_page_chat.js::appendChatMessage` routes them through `isSelfHealingStatusMessage()` (`agent_page_ui.js`) and RE-ASSERTS `disableControlsDuringOperation()`, so the Send button stays **Cancel** and the input stays disabled until the REAL final answer arrives. The matcher is ANCHORED (strip leading non-letters, then `startsWith('Tactic #') / "Tactic '"`) on purpose — a substring match would collide with the `recovery_preamble` "SELF-HEALING NOTE —" banner that quotes those same lines in the final answer and would jam the button on **Cancel forever**. The "🛑 You cancelled" line is deliberately NOT matched (after a cancel the controls SHOULD return). See `docs/claude/recent-fixes.md` (2026-07-07).

**Config:** `unified_agent_llm_step_max_tactics` (4096) / `unified_agent_llm_step_timeout_seconds` (80). Coverage: `agent/test_self_healing.py` + `agent/tests.py`; live-validated by `Tlamatini/tests_e2e/`. Do NOT remove the preamble, silence a failure, or wait on a model step without the watchdog.

## Multi-Turn now binds the full surface (2026-06)

When Multi-Turn is on, `CapabilityAwareToolAgentExecutor.invoke` (`mcp_agent.py`) binds **every enabled tool / agent / skill** — the complete request-scoped surface — **not** a narrow planner subset. ACPX is still filtered by its own checkbox (`agent.acpx.filter_acpx_tools`), so the only thing the bind drops is the ACPX/Skill surface when ACPX is unchecked.

This is the **fix for the starved-operator bug**: with 88 agents present, the old ≤20-tool planner subset routinely left the LLM reporting *"I don't have a file-writing or shell tool bound this turn,"* because the keyword-scored selection had crowded out the basics. The planner **still runs** — its capability hints and ordering are still computed and its summary is still forwarded into the prompt — but it **no longer removes a tool from the bind**.

### Cost trims that keep this affordable

Binding everything would balloon the prompt and re-pay the model's KV-cache cost every turn, so two trims offset it:

1. **One short line per tool in the system-prompt tool list.** `bind_tools` already sends the full name / description / parameter schema to the model out-of-band, so the multi-line tool descriptions that used to be repeated inside the system prompt were ~5k redundant tokens/turn. The system-prompt list is now a single short line per tool.
2. **`ChatOllama keep_alive`** — honours `OLLAMA_KEEP_ALIVE` (default `-1`), so the stable system-prompt prefix's KV cache is reused between turns instead of being recomputed each time.

---

## Step-by-Step Mode — one action at a time (Multi-Turn runtime modifier)

A toolbar checkbox (`#step-by-step-enabled`, sent per-request as `step_by_step_enabled`) that, like **Ask Execs**, is a **Multi-Turn runtime modifier**: with it on, the LLM gives **ONE concrete action at a time** and **waits for the user** to come back with a READY / screenshot / log / output before issuing the next action. It is for hands-on, interactive debugging and setup where each step depends on what the previous one actually produced.

### Plumbing path

The flag rides the same rails as Multi-Turn and is injected into the system prompt:

browser (`step_by_step_enabled`) → `consumers.py` → `rag/interface.py` → `rag/chains/unified.py` → `mcp_agent._build_system_prompt` (which injects the Step-by-Step guidance into the prompt).

### Whitelist contract (critical)

`step_by_step_enabled` **MUST stay in `UnifiedAgentChain.invoke`'s payload-rebuild whitelist** — the same drop-on-rebuild bug class that once broke `exec_report_enabled` and that the `ask_execs_enabled` contract above guards against. Drop it from the whitelist and the mode silently never engages.

### Bypass-validation interaction

`bypass_prompt_validation` is now computed as `multi_turn_enabled OR acpx_enabled OR step_by_step_enabled`, so a request with only Step-by-Step checked still skips prompt-shape validation (these are operator flows, not Q&A).

---

## Ask Execs — per-tool permission prompt (Multi-Turn-only modifier)

The chat toolbar's fourth checkbox, **Ask Execs** (between **ACPX** and **Add internet context**), makes the Multi-Turn executor **BLOCK on a browser Proceed/Deny dialog before each RISKY Tool/MCP/Agent runs** — "risky" meaning the explicit allowlist in the table below (command/script runners + destructive + human-contacting + remote/network), **not** literally every state-changing tool. A **Deny halts the whole chain**. It is sent per-request as `ask_execs_enabled` and, like Exec report, is **only honoured while Multi-Turn is on** (the checkbox is disabled+greyed otherwise; every backend read re-gates it on `multi_turn_enabled`). Unchecked → byte-for-byte the legacy Multi-Turn flow.

### The bridge (sync executor ↔ async consumer)

The tool executor is synchronous and runs in a worker thread (`sync_to_async(ask_rag, thread_sensitive=False)`), so it cannot `await`. `agent/exec_permission.py::ExecPermissionBroker` bridges it:

1. `consumers.queue_llm_retrieval` registers one broker per request (keyed by `conversation_user.id`) when `ask_execs_enabled`, and unregisters it in a `finally`. Its emit callback schedules an `exec_permission_request` group frame onto the consumer's event loop via `asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe`.
2. In `MultiTurnToolAgentExecutor.invoke`'s per-tool loop — **after** the dedup + quota checks, **before** `tool.invoke` — if `_requires_exec_permission(tool_name)`, it calls `broker.request_permission(detail)` which emits the frame and **blocks on a `threading.Event`**.

### ⚠️ WHICH tools prompt — an ALLOWLIST, not "everything" (corrected 2026-07-14)

`_requires_exec_permission` consults an **ALLOWLIST**, `mcp_agent.py::_ASK_EXECS_REQUIRED_TOOLS` — it does **NOT** prompt for every state-changing tool. (This doc used to claim it did; the claim was **wrong**, and the gap was real: **Deleter could wipe a glob of files, and Whatsapper could message a real human, with no prompt at all.** Angela found it live on 2026-07-14.)

**Angela's policy — tiers A + D are gated; tiers B and C deliberately are NOT.** *(Tier B was gated on 2026-07-14 and **REVERSED on 2026-07-26**: "Messages must be able to be sent without asking, it depends only on AI desisicion." Sending is the LLM's own judgement call — no prompt stands between Tlamatini and a message. What still protects a send: the LLM's judgement, the Exec Report row it always produces, and the user's Cancel. Zavuerer also costs money per send; that is accepted, not overlooked. Do NOT re-gate messaging "for safety" — `agent/test_ask_execs_allowlist.py::test_messaging_agents_are_NOT_gated` fails if you do.)*

| | Gated? | Tools |
|---|---|---|
| command / script runners | **ASK** | Executer, Pythonxer, SSHer, Kalier, Dockerer, Kuberneter, SQLer, Mongoxer, Gitter, Jenkinser, PSer, J-Decompiler (+ the direct `execute_command` / `execute_file` / `decompile_java`) |
| **A** — destroys/overwrites data | **ASK** | Deleter, Mover, File-Creator, Editor, De-Compresser, `unzip_file`, PDFer |
| **B** — messaging / reaches real people | **no-ask (ON PURPOSE, 2026-07-26)** | Emailer, Whatsapper, Telegrammer, Zavuerer, Instant Messaging Doctor |
| **D** — remote systems / network | **ASK** | SCPer, Apirer, Nmapper, Discoverer, Crawler |
| **C** — desktop UI + hardware | **no-ask (ON PURPOSE)** | Keyboarder, Mouser, Windower, Playwrighter, STM32er, ESP32er, Arduiner, ESPHomer, Blenderer, Unrealer |
| read-only / observational / management-polling / crypto / `invoke_skill` / ACPX | no-ask | Globber, Grepper, the interpreters, the media agents, `chat_agent_run_*`, … |

**Tier C is not an oversight.** Angela: *"I need the AI moves fast and they are operations of visible proceding: so don't make C set ask"* — you SEE the pointer move, the window shift, the board flash, so a prompt buys no safety and only costs speed. **Do not "helpfully" gate tier C.**

**When you add a new agent**: if it deletes/overwrites data, contacts a human, or reaches a remote system, **add its tool name to `_ASK_EXECS_REQUIRED_TOOLS`** — it is NOT automatic. Pinned in both directions by `agent/test_ask_execs_allowlist.py`.
3. The browser shows the modal (`showExecPermissionDialog`) and replies with an `exec-permission-response` frame → `consumers.receive` → `resolve_permission(user_id, request_id, decision)` sets the event.
4. **Proceed** → the tool runs. **Deny** → `self._exec_denied` is recorded and the executor returns immediately (no further tools, this turn or later).

The detail dict shown in the dialog: `tool_name`, `agent_display`, `kind` (Tool / Agent / MCP-ACPX / Skill via `_classify_tool_kind`), `program` (`_extract_exec_report_command`), `shell` (`_infer_execution_shell`), and pretty-printed `parameters`.

### Fail-safe contract (do NOT weaken)

- Emit failure / mid-flight Cancel / broker `close()` (browser disconnected) all resolve to **`deny`** — never run an unconfirmed state-changing tool. The wait loop polls `cancel_generation` on a short tick so a Cancel never deadlocks the thread.
- The **only** fail-OPEN case is "no broker registered" (unit tests / detached browser) — the consumer always registers one when `ask_execs_enabled`, so production never hits it.

### Runtime relax — unchecking Ask Execs mid-run (2026-05-29)

The flag captured at submit decides whether a broker is **registered** for the run; it cannot be un-captured. But the user CAN relax (or re-arm) an already-registered broker mid-flight by toggling the **Ask Execs** checkbox while a Multi-Turn run is executing:

1. The checkbox `change` handler (`agent_page_init.js`) sends a `set-ask-execs-runtime` frame (`{message, type, ask_execs_runtime_enabled}`) **only when `inLongOperation === true`**. The toolbar toggle checkboxes are deliberately NOT disabled by `disableControlsDuringOperation()`, so the box stays clickable during a run.
2. `consumers.receive` routes it to `exec_permission.set_broker_auto_proceed(user_id, auto_proceed=not enabled)`. Unchecked → `auto_proceed=True`; re-checked → `auto_proceed=False`. Returns `applied=False` (harmless no-op) if no broker is registered (run started with Ask Execs off — nothing to relax).
3. `ExecPermissionBroker.set_auto_proceed(True)` (a) makes every **future** `request_permission` return `"proceed"` immediately without emitting a prompt, and (b) resolves any **currently-blocking** prompt to `"proceed"` (mirrors `close()`, which resolves pending to `"deny"`). `set_auto_proceed(False)` re-arms prompting. It is a **no-op after `close()`** — a torn-down request never springs back to life.
4. When relaxing mid-run, the frontend also calls `dismissExecPermissionDialogForRuntimeProceed()` (`agent_page_dialogs.js`) to silently close any open prompt — it sets `_execPermDecisionSent = true` first so the dialog's close handler does NOT fire a stale `deny`.

Direction asymmetry by design: relaxing a run that **started** with Ask Execs **on** works (broker exists). Turning Ask Execs **on** mid-run for a run that started with it **off** does nothing that run (no broker was registered) — it takes effect on the next submit. Coverage: `ExecPermissionBrokerTests` (5 auto-proceed tests).

### Denial propagation + banner

`exec_report_denied` flows executor `_build_result_dict` → both chains' `result_dict` (independent of `exec_report_enabled`) → `interface.ask_rag` stores `last_exec_report_denied` in `global_state` → consumer reads+clears it → `services/response_parser.process_llm_response(..., exec_report_denied=...)` appends `_render_exec_denied_banner(...)` **after** the Exec report tables but **before** `save_message` (so a chat reload restores it). The banner (big red ⛔ "Execution interrupted") is NOT gated on the Exec report toggle.

### Whitelist contract (critical)

`ask_execs_enabled` **and** `conversation_user_id` (the executor finds its broker by user id) MUST stay in `UnifiedAgentChain.invoke`'s payload-rebuild whitelist — same drop-on-rebuild bug class that once broke `exec_report_enabled`. Both `UnifiedAgentChain` and `UnifiedAgentRAGChain` forward `ask_execs_enabled` + `ask_execs_user_id=conversation_user_id` into the executor sub-payload and return `exec_report_denied`. Adding a new payload flag here needs the same care. Both JS `exec-permission-response` frames include a `message` key because `consumers.receive` reads `text_data_json['message']` unconditionally. Full contract + coverage list in `docs/claude/recent-fixes.md` (2026-05-29).

## Create Flow from a Multi-Turn Answer

Every Multi-Turn response in which **at least one agent executed successfully** can be converted into a visual `.flw` workflow by clicking the **"Create Flow"** button rendered in the chat message header. There is **no whole-answer SUCCESS/FAILURE classifier** (dropped 2026-07-06): the button's only precondition is "Multi-Turn ran and ≥1 agent succeeded", and the generated flow is built from **only the successfully-executed agents** — failed executions are dropped.

Pipeline:

1. **Tool-call log capture**: `MultiTurnToolAgentExecutor` in `mcp_agent.py` records each tool invocation into a per-request `_tool_calls_log`, each entry carrying a `success` boolean. Management tools (`chat_agent_stat_getter`, etc.) are excluded.
2. **WebSocket broadcast**: `consumers.py` attaches `tool_calls_log` and `multi_turn_used` to the outgoing `agent_message` frame. *(The old LLM-based SUCCESS/FAILURE answer classifier — `answer_analizer.py::analyze_answer_success()` — was removed 2026-07-06; no `answer_success` flag is computed or broadcast anymore.)*
3. **Button gate (frontend)**: `agent_page_chat.js` renders the "Create Flow" button whenever Multi-Turn was enabled, the tool-call log contains **at least one successful call** (`_hasSuccessfulToolCalls`), and the user is not anonymous — then validates every canonical agent name against the live Agents registry (`_missingAgents`, itself filtered to successful calls) before enabling it. There is no verdict on the prose answer.
4. **Flow synthesis (frontend draft)**: `_generateAndDownloadFlow()` walks **only the successfully-executed tool calls** (`entry.success === true`), maps each tool name to its sidebar agent display name, lays out one node per successful call, wires the sequential `Starter → … → Ender` chain, and assembles a legacy-shaped `flowData` object. Failed executions are never turned into nodes.
5. **Backend normalization (`/agent/flow_from_tool_calls/`)**: `_normalizeChatFlowBeforeDownload()` POSTs the draft (plus a **successful-only** `tool_calls_log`) to `flow_from_tool_calls_view`, which runs it through `flow_spec.normalize_flow_payload()` and returns `flow_spec_to_legacy_json(spec, redact=True)` — a registry-canonical `.flw` whose agent names match the contracts and whose `secret_paths` are stripped. **Failure mode**: if the request fails (offline frozen install, backend down) the browser falls back to the original legacy draft so the user still gets a usable file.
6. **Download**: Whichever shape comes back is `Blob`-wrapped and downloaded under a timestamped filename.

Files involved:

- `agent/services/response_parser.py` — strips `END-RESPONSE` sentinel and related artifacts *(no longer runs any answer classifier)*
- `agent/services/flow_spec.py` — `normalize_flow_payload` / `flow_spec_to_legacy_json` (called by `flow_from_tool_calls_view`)
- `agent/services/flow_compiler.py` — shared `compile_flow_payload` so chat-generated flows produce the same registry-canonical artifacts as canvas-generated ones
- `agent/mcp_agent.py` — `_tool_calls_log` accumulation and wrapped-agent dedup
- `agent/consumers.py` — broadcasts `tool_calls_log` + `multi_turn_used`
- `agent/views.py::flow_from_tool_calls_view` — backend normalizer endpoint
- `agent/static/agent/js/agent_page_chat.js` — button render + `_generateAndDownloadFlow` (now `async`) + `_normalizeChatFlowBeforeDownload`
- `agent/static/agent/css/agent_page.css` — `.create-flow` button styling

## Unified Section Format (Parametrizer)

All 16+ section-generating agents use a single output format:

```
INI_SECTION_<AGENT_TYPE><<<
key1: value1
key2: value2

multi-line body content (becomes 'response_body')
>>>END_SECTION_<AGENT_TYPE>
```

Rules:
- `<AGENT_TYPE>` = UPPERCASE base name (e.g., APIRER, CRAWLER, GOOGLER)
- KV header before first blank line; body after first blank line
- Each section MUST be emitted in a **single `logging.info()` call** (atomic)
- One section per output unit (N results = N sections)

Registration (3 places):
1. `parametrizer.py` → `SECTION_AGENT_TYPES` list
2. `views.py` → `PARAMETRIZER_SOURCE_OUTPUT_FIELDS` dict
3. `README.md` → Supported Source Agents table

The generic parser (`_parse_section_content` + `_section_regex`) in `parametrizer.py` handles all agents with ~90 lines. No per-agent parser code needed.

Registered source agents: apirer, gitter, kuberneter, crawler, summarizer, prompter, flowcreator, file_interpreter, image_interpreter, file_extractor, kyber_keygen, kyber_cipher, kyber_decipher, gatewayer, gateway_relayer, de_compresser, googler, acpxer, shoter, camcorder, recorder, audioplayer, videoplayer, talker, whisperer, mouser, windower, unrealer, reviewer, analyzer, playwrighter, kalier, stm32er, esp32er, arduiner, discoverer, mcp_doctor, instant_messaging_doctor, telegrammer, whatsapper, zavuerer, video_analyzer, pdfer.
