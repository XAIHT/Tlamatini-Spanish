# Tlamatini — Exec Report (Per-Agent Execution Tables on the Final Answer)

When the **"Exec Report"** toolbar checkbox is ticked alongside Multi-Turn, the final answer gets a sequence of HTML tables appended to it — one table per kind of state-changing agent that actually fired, each row = one real tool call + SUCCESS/FAILURE verdict. It is the ground-truth "show-your-work" counterpart to the LLM's prose summary. *(This per-tool SUCCESS/FAILURE verdict is unrelated to — and outlived — the removed whole-answer classifier; see `docs/claude/multi-turn.md`.)*

**Checkbox gating (2026-07-06):** Exec report is a Multi-Turn modifier, so its checkbox is **enabled only while Multi-Turn is checked** — `syncExecReportAvailability()` in `agent_page_state.js` disables + greys it otherwise (mirroring Ask Execs), wired on load, on every Multi-Turn `change`, and on the Step-by-Step force-enable in `agent_page_init.js`. `isExecReportEnabled()` already returns `false` when Multi-Turn is off, so the backend never captures/renders; the gating just makes the dependency obvious in the UI.

## Scope — what gets captured

Captured tools live in a single module-level map in `agent/mcp_agent.py`:

```python
_EXEC_REPORT_TOOLS: Dict[str, Tuple[str, str]] = {
    # (tool_name): (agent_key, agent_display)

}
```

Direct @tool calls and wrapped `chat_agent_*` launches that correspond to the same agent share an `agent_key` on purpose — their rows merge into one "List of <Agent> Operations" table.

### ⚠️ Completeness contract (2026-06-07): EVERY Multi-Turn agent is captured — `_EXEC_REPORT_TOOLS` is no longer the gate

The map above is **no longer the gate for *whether* an agent is captured.** The Exec report must show **every agent that actually runs during a Multi-Turn request** — observational/output agents (Talker, Whisperer, Shoter, Camcorder, Recorder, AudioPlayer, VideoPlayer), read-only LLM agents (Crawler, Prompter, Summarizer, File-Interpreter/Extractor, Image-Interpreter, Monitor-*, Recmailer, Asker, Sleeper), AND any **newly-created** agent — all of them. (Previously the observational/read-only agents were intentionally absent; that produced the bug where a Talker run with Exec-report ON generated **no tables at all**.)

Capture is now driven by **`mcp_agent.py::_resolve_exec_report_spec(tool_name)`**, which resolves in order: (1) the curated `_EXEC_REPORT_TOOLS` map (still wins — for shared agent_keys that merge a direct @tool with its wrapped launch, nicer display casing, and a CSS-matched caption gradient); (2) a **generic fallback** that captures ANY wrapped `chat_agent_*` not in `_MANAGEMENT_TOOLS`, deriving `agent_key` from the registry spec key (separators stripped) and `agent_display` from `spec.display_name`. So a brand-new Multi-Turn agent is captured the instant it is wired as a `chat_agent_*` tool, with **zero** changes to `_EXEC_REPORT_TOOLS`.

The ONLY tools never captured: the management/polling helpers in `_MANAGEMENT_TOOLS` (`chat_agent_run_*`, `window_present`, `agent_stat_getter`, `get_current_time`) and direct read-only @tools (`googler`, `launch_view_image`). The visual canvas ACPXer node is not an LLM tool so it still contributes no rows. Entries in `_EXEC_REPORT_TOOLS` are therefore an **optional refinement**, not a requirement — a Multi-Turn agent with no entry there is still captured via the generic fallback and rendered with the default caption background (`.exec-report-caption` in `agent_page.css`).

**Worked example — MCP Doctor (`chat_agent_mcp_doctor`)**: this Multi-Turn agent has **no** `_EXEC_REPORT_TOOLS` entry, yet it is captured automatically by `_resolve_exec_report_spec` (generic fallback → `agent_key="mcpdoctor"`, display `MCP Doctor`) and renders with the default caption. (The genuinely newest wrapped agent, `chat_agent_flowcreator` (2026-07-22), is captured exactly the same way — generic fallback → `agent_key="flowcreator"`, display `FlowCreator`, no `_EXEC_REPORT_TOOLS` entry needed.) This is the expected behavior for every new wrapped `chat_agent_*` — no Exec-report code is written.

**NOT captured — the External MCP surface.** The 10 External-MCP supervisor tools (`external_mcp_status` / `reconnect` / `doctor` / `runtime_status` / `runtime_install` / `list_tools` / `call` / `import` / `set_active` / `wait`) and the lazily-bound `ext__<server>__<tool>` remote tools are **not** in the Exec Report — they are not `chat_agent_*` tools and so do not hit the wrapped-agent fallback (and they are not in `_EXEC_REPORT_TOOLS`). The static **MCP Doctor agent** (`chat_agent_mcp_doctor`) IS captured (above); the live `external_mcp_*` tools are not.

**Note on the visual ACPXer agent**: ACPXer is a *canvas* workflow node, not an LLM-invoked tool, so it does NOT contribute rows to `_EXEC_REPORT_TOOLS`. The Exec Report only covers tools the LLM calls in Multi-Turn mode. When the LLM drives ACPX via `acp_spawn` / `acp_send` / `acp_send_and_wait` / `acp_kill` / `acp_relay`, those calls already merge into the "List of ACPx Operations" table under `agent_key="acpx"`. If a future wrapped chat-agent (`chat_agent_acpxer`) is added so the LLM can launch the visual ACPXer node from chat, register it as `("chat_agent_acpxer", ("acpxer", "ACPXer"))` so it gets its own table — distinct from the existing `acpx` rows, since the visual surface is a different operational concept (one canvas node = one full lifecycle, vs. the 12 tools' fine-grained primitives).

## Pipeline

1. **Capture** — `MultiTurnToolAgentExecutor._invoke_tool()` checks `_EXEC_REPORT_TOOLS.get(tool_name)` after every tool invocation. If the tool is in the map, it appends `{tool_name, agent_key, agent_display, command, success}` to `self._exec_report_entries`. Capture is **unconditional** (ignores the per-request flag) — this prevents a future whitelist-style bug from silently hiding data. **Capture also fires on the `tool.invoke(...)` exception path** with `success=False`, so ACPX/Skill rows still appear when the underlying CLI is missing on PATH, the harness raised, or the args were malformed (exactly the cases the user most needs to see). `_extract_exec_report_command(tool_input, tool_name)` is tool-name-aware: ACPX `acp_spawn` renders as `[<agent_id>] <task>`, `acp_send` as `[<session_id>] <text>`, `acp_kill` as `kill <session_id>`, and `invoke_skill` as `<skill_name>(<args>)`.
2. **Flag** — `self._exec_report_enabled` is set from `payload["exec_report_enabled"]` at the start of `invoke()`. It only gates whether the entries are surfaced in the return dict under the `exec_report_enabled` key, not whether they are captured.
3. **Return** — `_build_result_dict()` always emits `exec_report_entries` (list) and `exec_report_enabled` (bool) alongside `output` and `tool_calls_log`.
4. **Chain forward** — `UnifiedAgentChain.invoke()` (and `UnifiedAgentRAGChain.invoke()`) pick up `exec_report_entries` from the executor's result and only add it to their own `result_dict` when the incoming payload had `exec_report_enabled=True`. **Note: `exec_report_enabled` is in `UnifiedAgentChain.invoke`'s payload-rebuild whitelist — removing it silently breaks the whole feature** (see `docs/claude/recent-fixes.md`).
5. **Global state handoff** — `ask_rag()` in `rag/interface.py` stores `last_exec_report_enabled` and `last_exec_report_entries` in `global_state` after the chain returns.
6. **Consumer** — `AgentConsumer.queue_llm_retrieval()` reads from `global_state`, clears immediately (to prevent leakage into the next request), and passes both to `process_llm_response`.
7. **Render** — `_render_exec_report_html(entries)` in `services/response_parser.py` groups entries by `agent_key` in **first-appearance order** (not alphabetical) and emits one `<table class="exec-report-table exec-report-<agent_key>">` per unique agent, with caption `List of <agent_display> Operations`. Empty input returns `""`.
8. **Append (boundary-isolated)** — `process_llm_response()` joins the exec-report HTML onto `llm_response` **only when `exec_report_enabled=True`**, but it does NOT bare-concatenate: it prefixes the system section (exec tables + any denial banner) with the `EXEC_REPORT_BOUNDARY` sentinel (`<!--TLAMATINI_EXEC_REPORT_BOUNDARY-->`). The frontend (`agent_page_chat.js::buildAutomatedMessageElement`) splits on that marker and parses each half in its **own `innerHTML`**, so a malformed/unclosed HTML answer table can never foster-parent the exec tables into itself. **Keep the `EXEC_REPORT_BOUNDARY` constant byte-identical in `response_parser.py` and `agent_page_chat.js`.** See `docs/claude/recent-fixes.md` (2026-06-05).
9. **Persist (strict ordering contract)** — `save_message(bot_user, llm_response, ...)` **must run AFTER the exec-report HTML has been appended to `llm_response`**, not before. This is the only reason reloading the chat history restores the per-agent tables verbatim. The ordering inside `process_llm_response()` is therefore: (a) strip `END-RESPONSE` and artifacts, (b) append exec-report HTML, (b2) append the **Ask-Execs denial banner** if `exec_report_denied` is present (see below), (c) **then** `save_message`, (d) broadcast over WebSocket. *(An earlier revision ran an LLM SUCCESS/FAILURE classification of the prose answer here; that step and its classifier `answer_analizer.py` were removed 2026-07-06.)* Moving `save_message` back above step (b) — as an earlier revision of the file did — silently breaks exec-report persistence across chat reloads while leaving the live-broadcast path working, which makes the regression invisible in manual testing until the user reloads the page. Do not reorder these steps.

## Interplay with Ask Execs (the denial banner)

When the **Ask Execs** toggle is on (a Multi-Turn-only modifier — see `docs/claude/multi-turn.md`) and the user **denies** a tool, the executor halts the chain and emits `exec_report_denied` alongside `exec_report_entries`. Two consequences for the Exec report:

- The **denied tool never executed**, so it does **not** appear in `exec_report_entries` — only the tools that actually ran (before the denial) are captured, exactly as for any normal run.
- `services/response_parser._render_exec_denied_banner(exec_report_denied)` renders a big red "Execution interrupted" banner naming the denied Tool/MCP/Agent + its program/shell/parameters. It is appended in `process_llm_response()` **after** the exec-report tables (step c2 above) and **before** `save_message`, so the user sees what *did* run, then the stop. **The banner is independent of `exec_report_enabled`** — it always shows on a denial; only the tables are gated on the toggle. CSS lives in `agent_page.css` under `.exec-denied-*`.

## Success/failure classification — deterministic engine + closed vocabulary (`agent_verdict.py`, 2026-08-16, v1.48.15)

The verdict on each row is still the single `call_success` variable computed at the top of `_invoke_tool()` (so the row, the dedup logic, the repetition detector and the `tool_calls_log` can never disagree) — but **how that boolean is derived changed**. It is no longer plain string-sniffing of the exit code; it is decided by **`agent/agent_verdict.py`**, a deterministic expert system.

### Why (the bug it exists to kill)

Two completely different questions were being collapsed into one string:

| | question | answer lives in |
|---|---|---|
| PROCESS | "did the child exit 0?" | the exit code — **one bit** |
| AGENT | "did the agent do the job, and what did it FIND?" | its `INI_SECTION` self-report — **a typed record** |

`tools._launch_wrapped_chat_agent` set `payload["status"]` from the exit code, and `_maybe_promote_section_fields_to_payload` then tried to lift the agent's own `status:` in with **`payload.setdefault(key, value)`** — a silent NO-OP on exactly the key that mattered. The agent's truthful self-report was **discarded**. Live consequence (Angela, LaTeXer wizard STEP 4): a linter asked to check a deliberately broken document found the bug exactly as designed, and the Exec Report stamped that row a red **FAILURE**.

### The rule table (ORDER IS THE ALGORITHM)

A lexer/parser turns the self-report into a typed AST (`SectionNode` → `KVNode` → coerced values); an ordered production-rule table then decides:

| rule | fires on | verdict |
|---|---|---|
| R1 | no self-report at all | the exit code |
| R2 | the agent declares `error` / `failed` (`AGENT_ERROR_STATUSES`) | **FAILED** |
| R3 | `refused` / `not_found` / `not_unique` / `engine_unavailable` … (`WORK_NOT_DONE_STATUSES`) — the work did NOT happen | **FAILED** |
| R3b | the output is degraded/compromised — `tokens_only`, `compiled_with_errors`, `operator_required` … (`WORK_DEGRADED_STATUSES`) | **FAILED** |
| R4 | a read-only diagnostic ran to completion — `invalid`, `findings`, `no_matches`, `listed` … (`DIAGNOSTIC_COMPLETED_STATUSES`) | **SUCCESS** |
| R5 | an explicit `success:` / `ok:` boolean | that boolean |
| R6 | a non-zero `errors:` count (`"0"` is **not** a failure) | **FAILED** |
| R7 | nothing decisive + non-zero exit | **FAILED** |
| R7b | the agent names an intact completion — `ok`, `completed`, `sent`, `created` … (`WORK_COMPLETED_STATUSES`) | **SUCCESS** |
| R8b | a non-empty `status:` token belongs to no vocabulary | fail-open **SUCCESS**, with the unknown token named in the rule evidence |
| R8 | no failure signal found | **SUCCESS** |

**R4 MUST outrank R5 and R6.** A linter that worked perfectly reports `status: invalid` **and** `success: False` **and** `errors: 2` in the same breath — the last two describe the **document**, not the agent. Testing them before R4 is precisely the bug this engine was written to kill.

### Contract (do NOT weaken)

- The agent's own self-report **OUTRANKS** the process exit code. An exit code is one bit; the self-report is a typed record.
- A self-report is **NEVER** dropped or overwritten. On a key collision the process view stays under `<key>` and the agent view lands on `agent_<key>` — **both** survive (`reconcile_payload_verdict`, called from `tools.py`). Never collapse them back into one key.
- A **read-only diagnostic that reports an adverse finding has SUCCEEDED** — the finding is the DELIVERABLE. A red row means no clean requested deliverable: the agent malfunctioned, the work did not happen, or the result is degraded. It never means merely *"the diagnostic found something"*.
- A fault-tolerant path is green only when the deliverable remains whole. `partial_interpreter_1_only` can be a valid completed interpretation; `tokens_only` cannot be successful speech because no audible result exists.
- **FAIL-OPEN**: every parse/coercion error resolves to "no opinion" and falls through to the next rule. Nothing in here may raise into a caller — a verdict engine that can break the chat path is worse than the mislabelled row it fixes.
- **100% DETERMINISTIC** — no model call, no heuristics. A probabilistic verdict engine could not be trusted to say whether something failed, and would cost a round-trip on every tool call.
- `mcp_agent._result_is_failure` honours the engine **only when `verdict.source == "agent"`**; every other case falls through to the legacy classifier, so ACPX / External-MCP / plain-text envelopes are untouched (`{"ok": false}` still goes red).
- The status vocabulary has **exactly ONE definition**: five pairwise-disjoint sets in `agent_verdict.py`, united as `KNOWN_STATUSES`. `mcp_agent` aliases the shared definitions. Two copies would drift, and a drifted copy silently mis-colours rows. Do **NOT** re-inline it.
- `agent/test_status_vocabulary.py` statically scans every shipping pool-agent source, extracts literal status tokens, rejects unknown/malformed/duplicated classifications, and rejects numeric exit-code variables interpolated into `status:`. Kuberneter is the canonical corrected shape: `returncode: <number>`, `success: true|false`, `status: ok|failed`.
- Stdlib only, and it imports nothing from `agent.*` — so it can never create an import cycle between `tools.py` and `mcp_agent.py` (both import it), and behaves identically frozen and from source.

Pinned by `agent/test_agent_verdict.py`, `agent/test_exec_report_verdict.py`, and `agent/test_status_vocabulary.py` (vocabulary shape, repository-wide token extraction, degraded results, completed results, unknown-token provenance, rule neutrality, and Kuberneter's numeric-status regression). Full story: `docs/claude/recent-fixes.md` (2026-08-06 origin; 2026-08-16 closed-vocabulary extension).

**Corollary for agent authors**: your agent's `status:` field is load-bearing — it is read, not decoration. Reuse a token from `KNOWN_STATUSES`; put numeric process results under `returncode` or `exit_code`, never `status:`. If your agent is a **read-only diagnostic**, exit `0` and report the finding in `status` / `errors`; do **not** tie the process exit code to how clean the user's input was. See LaTeXer's `validate_tex` and Kuberneter's structured result for the canonical diagnostic and CLI examples.

## Styling contract

Each `agent_key` needs a matching `.exec-report-caption-<agent_key>` CSS rule in `agent/static/agent/css/agent_page.css`. The gradient must **mirror the `.canvas-item.<agent_key>-agent` rule in `agentic_control_panel.css`** so the table feels native to the agentic UI. Also add a `.exec-report-<agent_key> .exec-report-cmd { border-left: 3px solid <primary>; }` accent. Dark-captioned tables additionally need an entry in the selector list of the `thead th` dark-tinted override rule.

## Adding an agent to the report (MANDATORY: every Multi-Turn agent must appear)

**Capture is now automatic.** Any agent you make Multi-Turn-callable (a wrapped `chat_agent_<name>` tool — see `create_new_agent.md` Step 7.5) is captured by `_resolve_exec_report_spec` with **no Exec-report code at all**, and rendered with the default caption background. So the baseline requirement is simply:

0. **(MANDATORY) Verify** your new Multi-Turn agent shows up: run it in Multi-Turn with **Exec report ON** and confirm a "List of <Agent> Operations" table appears. A Multi-Turn agent that produces no Exec-report row is a defect (this was the Talker bug). `python manage.py test agent.tests.ExecReportCaptureTests` includes an AUDIT test (`test_every_multiturn_agent_is_capturable_including_observational`) that fails if ANY wrapped chat-agent resolves to no row — so a regression is caught automatically.

**Optional refinement** (nicer styling / shared keys) — only if you want a native caption gradient or to merge a direct @tool with its wrapped launch:

1. `agent/mcp_agent.py` → add one entry to `_EXEC_REPORT_TOOLS` — `"<tool_name>": ("<agent_key>", "<Display Name>")` (use this to share an `agent_key` between a direct @tool and its `chat_agent_*` launch, or to fix the display casing the generic fallback derives).
2. `agent/static/agent/css/agent_page.css` → add `.exec-report-caption-<agent_key>` + `.exec-report-<agent_key> .exec-report-cmd` rules using the canvas-item gradient (otherwise the readable default `.exec-report-caption` background is used).
3. If the caption background is dark, also add `.exec-report-<agent_key> thead th` to the `color: #f5f5f5; background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.55)` selector list.

Then run `python manage.py test agent.tests.ExecReportCaptureTests` — the set exercises capture + grouping + render-order + flag-gating + the all-agents audit generically, so no per-agent test is needed.

## Files involved

- `agent/agent_verdict.py` — **the deterministic verdict engine** (parser + ordered rule table + five disjoint status sets + `KNOWN_STATUSES`). Imported by BOTH `tools.py` (`reconcile_payload_verdict`) and `mcp_agent.py` (`classify_payload`, shared aliases); stdlib-only, imports nothing from `agent.*`
- `agent/tools.py` — `_launch_wrapped_chat_agent` builds the payload and calls `agent_verdict.reconcile_payload_verdict(payload)` so the agent's self-report survives beside the process view
- `agent/mcp_agent.py` — `_EXEC_REPORT_TOOLS`, `_extract_exec_report_command`, `_invoke_tool` capture, `_result_is_failure` (honours the engine when `verdict.source == "agent"`), `_build_result_dict` emission
- `agent/rag/chains/unified.py` — payload whitelist **must** include `exec_report_enabled`; forward `exec_report_entries` on the way back
- `agent/rag/interface.py` — `global_state` handoff (`last_exec_report_enabled`, `last_exec_report_entries`)
- `agent/consumers.py` — `queue_llm_retrieval` reads state, passes to parser
- `agent/services/response_parser.py` — `_render_exec_report_html(entries)` + append-to-answer in `process_llm_response`
- `agent/static/agent/css/agent_page.css` — per-agent caption gradient and command-cell accent rules
- `agent/static/agent/js/agent_page_state.js`, `agent_page_init.js` — checkbox state + `exec_report_enabled` in WebSocket send
- `agent/templates/agent/agent_page.html` — **Exec Report** toolbar checkbox
- `agent/tests.py` — `ExecReportCaptureTests` (6 tests) + regression guards in `LoadedContextFallbackTests`
- `agent/test_agent_verdict.py` — pins the parser, original rules, **rule ORDER**, provenance, totality, and both call sites
- `agent/test_status_vocabulary.py` — repository-wide AST guard for every pool-agent status token, all five vocabularies, degraded/completed/unknown behavior, and the Kuberneter status shape
- `agent/test_exec_report_verdict.py` — the row-level regression that a completed diagnostic renders green
