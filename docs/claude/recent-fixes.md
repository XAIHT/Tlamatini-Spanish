## 2026-08-28 — Googler phase 1: EVERY Bing result was silently thrown away (`agents/googler/googler.py`)

Googler's Tier-0 plain-HTTP path has a per-engine **own-domain skip**: a result that still points at the search engine's own host is not a result, so it is dropped. Bing, however, does not hand out the destination URL — it wraps **every organic result** in its own click-tracker, `https://www.bing.com/ck/a?...&u=a1<base64url>`. `_unwrap_redirect` only knew the plain `uddg` / `q` / `u` / `url` query-parameter forms, so a Bing link **stayed on `bing.com`** and was then eaten by that very skip. The visible symptom was not an error: Bing returned a full page, Googler reported no usable links, and the tier **fell through to whatever the next engine happened to return** — so a search looked like it had "worked" while silently answering from a weaker source. **Do NOT revert.**

**Two things had to be fixed together, and the ordering is the whole trick.** Bing serves that URL with its ampersands HTML-escaped (`&amp;u=a1…`), so `urlsplit` + `parse_qs` never saw a `u` parameter at all — the unwrapper would have failed even once it knew to look. `_unwrap_redirect` therefore now `html.unescape()`s the raw value **first**, before parsing; only then does the `bing.com/ck/a` branch read `u`, strip the leading `a1` / `a2` marker Bing prefixes to the payload, restore the base64 padding (`token + '=' * (-len(token) % 4)`), `urlsafe_b64decode` it, and accept the result **only when it decodes to something starting with `http`**.

**It is fail-open by construction**, and deliberately so: every step sits inside `try/except`, and any failure — an unparseable URL, a marker Bing changes, a payload that is not valid base64, a decode that yields junk — simply falls through to the pre-existing `uddg` / `q` / `u` / `url` loop and then to the raw URL. A tracker format that drifts costs one engine's results, never an exception in the search path.

Also in the same pass: the `mojeek-http` engine's skip list widened from `('mojeek.com',)` to also cover `mastodon.social/@mojeek` and `buttondown.email/mojeek` — the engine's own social and newsletter properties were surviving the own-domain skip and being served back as if they were findings.

**The lesson is the NetSpeed-Calculator lesson again** (2026-08-23, *"a ZERO must always name its cause"*): the failure here was not that Bing broke, it is that **a silent drop is indistinguishable from an empty internet**. When a result-producing path discards candidates, the discard needs a reason a human can read — otherwise the layer degrades quietly and the fallback hides it.

**En este arbol el codigo ya estaba** (llego con el commit `58e3436`, "Googler improvement phase 1 under paired Tlamatinis staging"): verificado antes de portar — `ck/a` x2, `html.unescape` x2 y el filtro de `mastodon.social` presentes e identicos al ingles. Lo que faltaba era ESTA entrada del registro, y un arreglo sin su bitacora es un arreglo que el proximo lector deshace sin saber.

## 2026-08-29 — The frozen console's torch warning storm: ROOT-FIXED by keeping `transformers` out of the web process (and NOT by muting)

Ported from the English tree (its `64b29725`). A frozen launch opened with a wall of third-party import-time warnings that say nothing about Tlamatini's health, so **every boot read as "something is wrong"** and the lines that DO matter were buried: **twelve** identical `torch\_jit_internal.py:999: UserWarning: Unable to retrieve source for @torch.jit._overload function`, plus a `LangChainDeprecationWarning` and Django's `Accessing the database during app initialization` note.

**⚠️ THE FIRST ATTEMPT WAS MUTING AND WAS REJECTED.** Angela: *"Muting?? why not root-fixing!!"*. `warnings.filterwarnings` in `manage.py` / `settings.py` hid the symptom and left **911 useless modules loading on every boot**. `agent/test_web_process_stays_lean.py::NoWarningMutingTests` now FAILS the build if `filterwarnings` / `simplefilter` reappears in either startup file.

**Root cause**, found with an import tracer rather than by reasoning: `agent/mcp_agent.py` → `langchain_ollama` → `langchain_core` → `from transformers import GPT2TokenizerFast` → `import torch`. `langchain_core` imports `transformers` **only** as a GPT-2 token-counter FALLBACK and wraps it in `try/except ImportError`. Every Tlamatini model is an Ollama / Anthropic model that counts its own tokens, and nothing in `agent/**` imports transformers or a HuggingFace embedding — so the whole ML stack loaded for a path she never executes.

**The fix — one line in `build.py`: `'--exclude-module=transformers'`**, beside the existing `--exclude-module=magic` (the same "upstream guards the import, so excluding is safe" pattern). Measured in the English tree: 248 → **0** transformers submodules, 663 → **0** torch submodules, chain import 9.47 s → **3.62 s**. The twelve warnings disappear because torch is never imported — cause removed, nothing suppressed.

**⚠️ INTERPRETER BOUNDARY — and in THIS edition it also guards the voice.** Tlamatini ships two interpreters and they are NOT interchangeable. The exclusion applies **only to the FROZEN `_internal`** (the Django/RAG process). The **CARRIED** Python (`<install>/python`) runs the pool agents, and here `agents/talker/talker.py` imports **`torch` (16 refs) + `snac` (18)** and `agents/whisperer/whisperer.py` imports `torch` — so **`torch` is NEVER excluded**. Verified for this tree before porting: `tts_piper.py` imports neither (it shells out to `piper.exe`), and nothing in the voice chain imports `transformers`. **Excluding torch here would silence Tlamatini, which is the one outcome the golden rule forbids.**

**The second warning was OUR OWN CODE.** 13 imports of the deprecated `langchain.tools` shim — `agent/tools.py:15`, `agent/acpx/tools.py:27`, `agent/imaging/image_interpreter.py:14` and 10 in `agent/tests.py` — all switched to the canonical **`langchain_core.tools`**. Root-fixed, not muted.

**The third warning is NOT a defect and stays visible.** Django accurately reports `AgentConfig.ready()`'s **deliberate** agent-table rebuild. Silencing it would be muting again; removing it means restructuring boot ordering — do not do it casually, the agent registry depends on those rows existing before the first request.

**Contract — do NOT weaken:** (1) never re-add startup warning muting — fix the cause; (2) `--exclude-module=transformers` stays and **`torch` is never excluded** (Talker and Whisperer need it under the carried Python, and this edition's voice depends on it); (3) never add `transformers` to `requirements.txt`; (4) the exclusion is safe ONLY because `langchain_core` guards that import — `UpstreamContractTests` AST-checks the installed `langchain_core` for the `try/except ImportError` so a future upgrade fails loudly here instead of crashing a user's frozen app.

Coverage: `agent/test_web_process_stays_lean.py` (10 tests, green in this tree).

## 2026-08-26 — Blue-hat toolkit in the Spanish tree: evidence survives an update, and the `s` tag stops lying

Three things landed together while sweeping `security/` for this edition. All three were
**silent** failures — nothing on screen ever looked wrong — so each is pinned by a guard that
would have gone red before the fix.

**1. A self-update destroyed the operator's security evidence.** `security/` is application
code and *must* be replaced by a release (a fixed defender has to be able to reach a user who
already installed a broken one), so it is correctly absent from `apply_update.ps1`'s
`$Preserve`. But `security/security_logs/` — `alerts.log`, `monitor.log`, the visible
asset-test proof — lives *inside* that replaced directory, exactly like `db.sqlite3` lives
inside the replaced `_internal/`. The delete loop wiped it. `apply_update.ps1` now stashes it
to `Temp/_security_logs_carryover` (**step 3c**) and restores it into the new `security/`
(**step 5b**), mirroring the database's step 3b. **Both halves are required and ordered**: a
stash with no restore silently moves the evidence somewhere nobody looks, which is worse than
deleting it honestly. Both fail **open** — on any error the update still completes and the
evidence is *left* in the carryover directory rather than removed. Do not "simplify" this by
adding `security` to `$Preserve`: that would freeze the defender scripts forever.

**2. The Spanish edition letter silently corrupted two numeric version paths.** This tree tags
releases as `v1.50.2s` so a Spanish build is distinguishable from the English `v1.50.2`. That
letter is not SemVer, and `version._SEMVER_RE` is strict, so `parse_semver()` returned `None`
and two callers failed open in opposite, invisible ways:

- `semver_to_win32_tuple()` fell back to `(0, 0, 0, 0)` — **every Spanish `.exe` reported
  ProductVersion `0.0.0.0`** to Windows Explorer, installers and upgrade-detection logic, while
  the About dialog and startup banner still showed the correct string.
- `self_update._version_tuple()` fell through to its crude numeric split, which stops at the
  first non-digit field and therefore **dropped the patch number**: `1.49.1s` compared equal to
  `1.49.0s`, so **a Spanish user was never offered a patch release**. Only minor/major bumps
  got through.

The fix is `version.py::strip_edition_suffix()` reached through the private `_semver_body()`,
now used by `semver_to_win32_tuple` and by `self_update`. **Keep `parse_semver()` strict** — the
letter is normalised away before parsing, never accepted as valid SemVer — and **keep the letter
in every human-readable surface** (`get_version()`, the banner, `GET /agent/version/`, the
`ProductVersion` string). Anywhere a version becomes NUMBERS, go through `_semver_body()`.
Guard: `agent/test_edition_version_suffix.py`. Contract: `VERSIONING.md` → *The Spanish edition
letter*.

**3. The toolkit shipped undocumented, and the docs it did have pointed at nothing.** `security/`
was a byte-identical copy of the English tree with no Spanish counterpart to the English
README/Book sections — yet `security/README.md` told the reader to go read *"Enable Tlamatini as
a Blue-hat agent"* in `README.md` and `BookOfTlamatini.md`, sections that did not exist here.
Both now carry the Spanish runbook, `security/README.md` is Spanish, and the harness takes its
screenshots with `toma_foto` (this edition's Shoter convention) instead of `take_shot`.
⚠️ **The two `.ps1` files keep their English console strings on purpose**: the harness asserts on
exact phrases inside them (e.g. `verified in Audit mode`), so translating one side without the
other leaves a test that passes while proving nothing. Translate both in the same commit or
neither. Guard: `agent/test_security_assets_carriage.py`, which also pins that the docs promise
only sections that exist.

**4. Her own self-knowledge had rotted a full release behind source.** `agent/Tlamatini.md` is
not documentation *about* her — `rag/config.py` injects it into the **system prompt** as
`{self_knowledge}`, so it is what she answers from when a user asks what she is. It still said
**87 agents / 65 wrapped / 107 tools / 28 skills** while source had **88 / 66 / 108 / 29**:
NetSpeed-Calculator and the 29th skill landed and her self-description never followed. It
shipped inside every `--self-modify` build for a whole release. Two things were missing
outright: **the golden rule** (she could not state that she never speaks English — the single
defining fact of this edition) and **the Blue-hat toolkit** (she did not know `security/`
exists, so she would either deny having it or, worse, claim to have run a sweep she cannot
run). Both are now written in, and `CLAUDE.md`'s migration count was stale too (197 → **198**).

⚠️ **The guard is the point, not the numbers.** `agent/test_self_knowledge_is_current.py`
**derives** the agent / wrapped / skill counts from source — nothing is hand-typed — and also
checks the Multi-Turn breakdown *adds up* (`total == core + wrapped + acpx + supervisors`). Add
agent #89 and it fails and names the file to update. Never hand-type a count into a doc or a
test again; the prose rotted precisely because nothing could detect it. Note the snapshot
itself was always fine — a 1224-file audit showed every rebuild input carried and only private
data (`contacts.json`, `.private_targets.json`), generated files (`_version.py`) and 51 harness
run-artifacts excluded. **Shipping correctly is not the same as being correct.**

**Also corrected:** the ES docs quoted four English-tree commit hashes (`ae6fec4c`, `d161098e`,
`834eaa16`, `f948be7b`) that do not exist in this repository. They were replaced with this
tree's real identity. Never copy a commit hash across the two trees.

## 2026-08-23 — Googler structured dork builder: syntax is a compiled contract

The visual/pool Googler now compiles structured fields rather than trusting every flow author
to remember Google's spacing and binding rules. `agent/agents/googler/googler.py` owns aliases,
presets, field normalization, and `build_dork_query`; `config.yaml` is the user-facing schema;
`agent/test_googler_dorks.py` pins the contract.

**Do not weaken these invariants:** no space after an operator colon; exact phrases in double
quotes; uppercase `OR`; alternatives in parentheses; exclusions as `-term`; several sites or
file types as one grouped clause; explicit fields overriding preset defaults; and a site-`OR`
group enabling same-domain URL de-duplication. Keep `book_public` and `paper` pointed at
lawful/open or institutional sources rather than access-control workarounds.

For PDF/EPUB and other binary-file hunts, `content_mode: links_only` is a successful URL-list
deliverable. The downstream path is Parametrizer -> Apirer -> File-Extractor/File-Interpreter,
not an attempt to scrape binary bytes as page text. The direct Multi-Turn `googler` tool remains
a manual-query surface: put operators in `query`; do not advertise pool-only structured fields
as direct-tool parameters. Public indexing never grants download/use permission, and Googler
must never be described as bypassing access controls.

The same live proof exposed a second failure: bundled headless Chromium returned zero results
for a plain control query and every dork, while the old single DuckDuckGo fallback returned an
error page; the same query in headed installed Chrome returned real EPUB URLs. The pool agent
now has two tiers. Tier 0 uses plain `urllib` against four server-rendered routes (DuckDuckGo
HTML, Bing, DuckDuckGo Lite, Mojeek), avoiding browser fingerprints, consent/JS failures, and
CSS-selector dependence. Only when all four are empty does Tier 1 default to visible installed
Chrome, fall back to bundled Chromium, and walk seven direct-result browser routes. Each route
receives bounded jittered retries, and the log names the route that answered. An explicit
`engines` list skips Tier 0. **Do not collapse this back to a browser-only, two-engine, or
headless-only path.** `site:` and `filetype:` carry broadly, but advanced date/proximity/range
operators are Google-specific; fallback results may be broader, so pin `engines: [google]`
where exact semantics are required. Keep the tolerant boolean parser: wrapped string `"false"`
must remain false for both headless and same-domain settings. The 73-test deterministic suite
and optional headed `harness/googler_dork_hunt.py` proof protect this behavior.

## 2026-08-23 — Googler: the FULL dork vocabulary, and a search layer that stopped returning zero

**Angela:** *"add to Googler the capability to use dorks: all of them! … the internet
is not gonna be navigated by humans but AI crawlers."*

### Part 1 — the complete operator surface

`build_dork_query` went from 9 operators to the documented Google set, and the
builder now ENFORCES the syntax mechanically rather than trusting the caller,
because each of these silently degrades a filter into an ordinary keyword search
and returns plausible rubbish instead of an error:

| rule | broken form | what actually happens |
|---|---|---|
| no space after the colon | `filetype: pdf` | searches for the WORDS "filetype" and "pdf"; filters nothing |
| `OR` uppercase | `epub or pdf` | `or` is a stop word |
| parenthesise alternatives | `filetype:epub OR filetype:pdf` | the OR binds to one adjacent term |
| no space after `-` | `- review` | the exclusion is ignored |

New surface: **`filetypes`** (plural → `(filetype:epub OR filetype:pdf)`, with class
aliases `ebook`/`book`/`docs`/`slides`/`sheets`/`text`/`code`/`data`), **`sites`**,
**`exclude_sites`** (`-site:`), `author`, `allintitle`, `allinurl`, `allintext`,
`inanchor`, `allinanchor`, `related`, `cache`, `define`, `source`, `or_terms`,
`around_terms` + `around_distance` (`AROUND(n)`), `numeric_range` (`2020..2026`),
and **`preset`** — `book` / `book_public` / `paper` / `manual` / `docs` / `slides` /
`sheets` / `directory`. A preset fills ONLY what the caller left empty, so an
explicit field always wins. Singular `site`/`filetype` still work.

The `googler` **@tool docstring is now the operator manual** — Angela's explicit
requirement was that the LLM learn the vocabulary from the tool description, so
the rules, the file/book patterns, every operator and the workflow live there.

### Part 2 — ⛔ a located FILE is a RESULT, not an error

`_googler_fetch_page_text` returned `"Binary file detected … skipped"` for any
PDF/EPUB hit. For a `filetype:` hunt EVERY hit is binary by construction, so a
perfectly successful file hunt read as N consecutive failures and the download
URLs — the actual deliverable — were framed as errors. A binary hit is now a
first-class `kind: "file"` record rendered as **FILE FOUND** with its extension,
content-type and byte size. **Do not turn this back into an error.**

### Part 3 — the search layer returned ZERO for EVERYTHING

Measured while proving the dorks live: the pool agent returned **0 results for
every query**, including a plain-keyword control with no operators at all.
Google timed out waiting for its result container; the single DuckDuckGo
fallback answered **"Unexpected error. Please try again."** (confirmed by reading
the agent's own debug screenshot with Image-Interpreter). The SAME dork through a
**headed real-Chrome** window returned 10 real EPUB URLs immediately.

Two root causes: a headless JS app being refused, and having exactly ONE fallback
which happened to be down. The redesign:

1. **TIER 0 IS PLAIN HTTP, NO BROWSER** — `urllib` requests four server-rendered
   routes: DuckDuckGo HTML, Bing, DuckDuckGo Lite, and Mojeek. This removes browser
   fingerprint, consent, JavaScript-app, and stale-selector failure classes.

   ⚠️ **A first draft of this entry justified Tier 0 by calling the JS-free
   endpoints "the most reliable thing in the file" — which was wrong as written,
   and the measurement is the useful part.** Those same endpoints returned
   NOTHING through Playwright, because their class names had gone stale
   (DuckDuckGo renders `web-result` / `result__title` now, not `a.result__a`).
   Bare `urllib` with ordinary browser headers, same urls, same minute:

   | endpoint | plain HTTP | via Playwright |
   |---|---|---|
   | `html.duckduckgo.com` | **200**, 3 gutenberg.org URLs | 0 (stale selectors) |
   | `www.bing.com` | **200**, 23 gutenberg.org URLs | 0 (stale selectors) |
   | `mojeek.com` | 403 Forbidden | 0 |
   | `search.brave.com` | connection reset | **answered** |

   So the claim that survives evidence is narrower: **for a server-rendered
   results page the browser is the LIABILITY, not the asset** — and the failure
   it removes is not mainly fingerprinting but **selector rot**, since
   `_http_search` harvests `href`s with a regex and a result's class names may
   change while its outbound link cannot. Brave is the counter-example that
   earns the browser tier its place: it refuses raw HTTP and answers only
   through a real browser, which is why Tier 1 was kept rather than deleted.
2. **TIER 1 HAS SEVEN BROWSER ROUTES** (ddg-html, ddg-lite, mojeek, bing, google,
   brave, startpage) — only after Tier 0 is empty. An explicit `engines` list pins
   Tier 1 and deliberately skips Tier 0.
3. **Direct result URLs**, never typing into a search box and pressing Enter.
4. **Jittered retry/backoff** per route before falling through.
5. **Real Chrome (`channel="chrome"`), HEADED BY DEFAULT FOR TIER 1** —
   `headless: false` is the default and headless is the documented degraded path.
6. `_unwrap_redirect` resolves `duckduckgo.com/l/?uddg=` and `/url?q=` wrappers —
   left wrapped they are useless as file URLs and all collapse to one domain,
   which the de-duplicator would then discard as repeats of a single host.

**The engine that actually answered is ALWAYS logged**, so a report can never
imply Google answered when Mojeek did. Only Google honours the full vocabulary —
`before:`/`after:`/`AROUND()`/numeric ranges are Google-only, while `site:` and
`filetype:` work everywhere — so pin `engines: [google]` when a dork needs them.

**Honest limit:** this is robustness, not an evasion arms race. There is no
CAPTCHA solving and no proxy/IP rotation, and "invulnerable" is not a property
any scraper can claim. The durable answer is FETCHING server-rendered pages over
plain HTTP and parsing them by `href` rather than by class name — plus, where a
key exists, an official search API. Note this is the opposite of the usual
instinct: the fix was to use LESS browser, not a better-disguised one.

### Two traps found while proving it

* **The placeholder default poisoned every structured search.** `config.yaml`
  shipped `query: "example search topic"`, and because the wrapped-agent launcher
  OMITS empty values to protect template defaults, that placeholder could not be
  cleared — it was appended to every dork built from `exact`/`filetypes`/`sites`,
  turning a precise hunt into a search for a phrase that appears nowhere. Now
  `query: ""`.
* **Extensionless file URLs.** arXiv serves every paper as `arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762`
  with no `.pdf`, so extension-only detection reported "10 hits, 0 files" for a
  search whose every hit WAS a PDF. The direct @tool is safe (it reads
  Content-Type), but any URL-only classifier needs the path-marker fallback.

**Named, re-runnable proof:** `.claude/skills/tlamatini-daily-chat-test/harness/googler_dork_hunt.py`
— builds each dork with the SHIPPED `build_dork_query`, drives a VISIBLE Chrome,
and reports FILE FOUND URLs. `--list`, `--hunt <name>`, `--title "..."`.
Coverage: `agent/test_googler_dorks.py` (**73 tests** — the syntax rules, every
operator, aliases, presets, tolerant booleans, four-route HTTP-before-browser order,
seven-route browser order, pinned-engine Tier-0 bypass, retry/first-answer behavior,
redirect unwrapping, and Angela's own example queries reproduced verbatim).

## 2026-08-23 — NetSpeed-Calculator (agent #88): four dead endpoints, and the rule that a ZERO must always name its cause

**Angela's instruction:** *"Continue!!!"* — the previous session had written the
agent, proven the framework live, found that **download returned 0 bytes**,
characterized the endpoints, announced *"Now fixing the four real bugs"*, and hit
its usage limit on that exact line. This entry is what those bugs were, what the
fix contract is, and the three traps found while wiring the agent across ~30
surfaces.

### The measurement engine

`agent/agents/netspeed_calculator/netspeed_calculator.py` measures the machine's
Internet connection and publishes the answer **with its error bar**: RFC 6349 TCP
throughput + RFC 3550 §6.4.1 jitter, N parallel streams per provider per
direction, the slow-start ramp DISCARDED, throughput sampled as **d(bytes)/dt**
rather than total÷elapsed, Tukey-IQR outlier rejection, a trimmed mean and a
Student-t interval — then a **DerSimonian-Laird random-effects meta-analysis**
across providers publishing a 95% CI and the I² heterogeneity figure. Bufferbloat
is the RTT increase UNDER load, graded A+..F. Stdlib-only (+ `yaml`), never
imports `agent.*`.

### ⛔ THE LOAD-BEARING CONTRACT: a transfer that moved ZERO bytes MUST name its cause

`_download_worker` / `_upload_worker` used to swallow **every** exception, so a
dead endpoint produced a confident `0.00 Mbps` **with no reason printed**. That is
the single most expensive defect this agent can ship: a silent zero is
indistinguishable from a slow link, so it sends the user hunting a fault in their
own house. It is also why bugs 1 and 4 below each cost a full debugging session
to find.

- `_record_error(errors, exc)` — keeps the first **5 DISTINCT** failures (bounded
  because six streams retrying for eight seconds would otherwise bury the log;
  bounded is NOT the same as hidden).
- `_report_dead_transfer(key, direction, raw, red)` — when `total_bytes == 0` it
  prints every reason AND stores them in `red["why"]`, so the saved artifact
  carries the explanation too. A transfer with bytes is a no-op.
- `_run_transfer` threads a shared `errors` list into every worker and returns it.

**DO NOT reintroduce a silent zero.** If you add a direction, a provider or a
transport, it must funnel its failures through `_record_error`.

### The four bugs — every one MEASURED, none guessed

| # | Bug | Evidence (measured 2026-08-22) | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Cloudflare rejects an oversized object | `bytes=100000000` → **HTTP 403**; `bytes=25000000` → 200 | `_CF_MAX_DOWN_BYTES = 25_000_000` clamp in `_discover_cloudflare` |
| 2 | LibreSpeed's hardcoded backend is gone | `librespeed.org/backend/garbage.php` AND `empty.php` → **404** | discover from the project's **public server list** (`/backend-servers/servers.php`), pick by measured RTT |
| 3 | Hetzner's host no longer resolves | `speed.hetzner.de` → **getaddrinfo failed (NXDOMAIN)** | the `.com` datacentre mirror mesh (`hil/ash/nbg1/fsn1/hel1/sin-speed.hetzner.com`, all 200) + `_pick_by_rtt` |
| 4 | **The cache-buster was killing the provider** | `https://ash-speed.hetzner.com/100MB.bin` → **200**; the SAME url with `?nocache=…` → **RemoteDisconnected** | per-provider `"cache_bust": False` in `_discover_hetzner` **plus** a runtime self-heal in `_download_worker` |

**Bug 4 is the subtle one and the reason for the self-heal.** `_bust()` exists to
stop a CDN edge serving the same cached object to every stream — i.e. to PROTECT
the measurement. On a static mirror that rejects unknown query strings it
DESTROYED it instead: all six streams reset instantly, forever, silently. The
worker now drops the buster after a failure with `local == 0` and lets the next
iteration prove the plain URL. **The trade is deliberate and one-sided: a cached
object can only make a result look TOO GOOD, while a connection reset makes a
working link look like no Internet at all.**

`_pick_by_rtt` had been written for exactly this and was **wired to nothing** —
mirror lists are published by geography, and geography is only a proxy for network
distance (measured from Mexico City: Hetzner US ~265 ms, German ~391 ms,
Singapore ~453 ms). Its docstring previously quoted numbers that no longer held;
it now quotes the measured ones.

**Proven live, before and after:** cloudflare 0 → **91.96 Mbps**; librespeed
404 → **93.56 down / 47.65 up** (the RTT picker chose Denver at 57 ms over
Amsterdam at 144 ms, and the near server drains an upload the far one timed out
on); hetzner 0 → **92.31**; cachefly **93.38**. Aggregate **92.82 Mbps ±0.74**,
4/4 providers, 0 failed.

### ⚠️ TRAP 1 — the SPACED impostor Agent row (found by re-checking, not by testing)

The DB held **two** rows: `Netspeed Calculator` (spaced) and
`NetSpeed-Calculator`. The spaced one was seeded by a server boot that happened
while the agent DIRECTORY existed but the `display_name_from_agent_type` override
did **not** — so `apps.py` derived it with `.title()`. A spaced name matches
nothing in `acp-canvas-core.js` (it lowercases WITHOUT collapsing whitespace), so
every canvas connection would have been silently dropped.

`apps.ready()` self-heals it (it deletes all rows and rebuilds via
`_canonical_agent_display_name`), **verified live**: `Repopulating 88 agents` →
exactly one row, `id=55 NetSpeed-Calculator`.

**Rule: after creating an agent directory, RESTART the server once and re-check
the row before believing any naming work is done.** This is also why the display
name is HYPHENATED on purpose — with a hyphen the canvas literal and the CSS
classMap key are the SAME string, so the space-vs-hyphen trap cannot occur for
this agent at all.

### ⚠️ TRAP 2 — `collectstatic` is part of "wiring the frontend"

All six JS/CSS wiring edits existed in `agent/static/` but **not** in the
`staticfiles/` copies WhiteNoise actually serves, so in a browser the node would
have had no connector at all. **After ANY js/css/template change: run
`collectstatic`, hash-verify source vs collected, then restart** (see also
`feedback_never_hotswap_static_into_running_app`). `test_checkbox_bulk_toggle.py`
and `test_dialog_dismissal_policy.py` assert collected-static sync — they are the
guards that catch this.

### ⚠️ TRAP 3 — a count bump is NOT a catalog entry

Updating every "87 → 88" left **eleven** per-agent TABLES stale, because they sit
beside the counts rather than in them: the Ask-Execs tier-D table
(`multi-turn.md`), the `_EXEC_REPORT_TOOLS` map (`exec-report.md`), FlowCreator's
**Quick-Reference table** AND **Agent Selection Priority Rules**, `Tlamatini.md`'s
self-knowledge bullet, KIMI's §13 catalog row, and the Book's **Bestiary AND
Glossary** tables. **When adding an agent, grep for a SIBLING agent's name — not
for the old number.**

### Three surfaces the runbook gets wrong (corrected in the skill + workflow guide)

1. `views.PARAMETRIZER_SOURCE_OUTPUT_FIELDS` is **derived** (`= get_parametrizer_source_fields()`), not hand-maintained — only `agent_contracts._PARAMETRIZER_OUTPUT_FIELDS` needs the entry.
2. `urls.py` wraps connection views in **`secure_post(...)`**.
3. `tools.py` has a `_PRE_LAUNCH_PREVIEW_BY_TEMPLATE` / `_PRE_LAUNCH_PREVIEW_OBSERVATIONAL_TEMPLATES` pair, and a contract test requires every wrapped agent to be in **exactly one** of them.

### Policy decisions (do not "helpfully" reverse)

- **Ask-Execs tier D (GATED)** — it reaches remote hosts like Crawler AND
  deliberately saturates the link with ~100-200 MB of real, possibly METERED
  traffic per full run. Pinned by `test_ask_execs_allowlist.py::TIER_D`.
- The daily-chat harness question uses **`action='latency'`**, never `full` — that
  bank may run 1000×/day and a full run costs real bandwidth every time.
- A **read-only diagnostic that reports an adverse finding has SUCCEEDED**: the
  preflight REFUSES (`status: refused`) rather than publish a number it cannot
  trust, and a partial measurement clearly labelled partial is the CORRECT
  outcome, not a failure.

**Coverage:** `agent/test_netspeed_calculator_agent.py` (**262 tests** — statistics,
outlier rejection, the meta-analysis, bufferbloat bands, the cache-buster
self-heal, error surfacing, all four endpoint regressions, registry integration,
and static JS/CSS/doc contracts), plus a re-runnable 12-pass / 91-check wiring
audit. Migrations **0195/0196/0197**; catalog prompt **119**
(`run_execute`, `sort_rank=70`).

## 2026-08-16 — ESCAPE CLOSES EVERY DIALOG (the dismissal policy, inverted)

> **Release lineage for this day (three annotated tags):** `v1.48.15` = `9531b43f`
> (encoding-safe Grepper + the closed verdict vocabulary + updater preservation),
> `v1.48.16` = `6ee630ca` (themed `tlmAlert`/`tlmConfirm` pop-ups + the
> frozen-bundle carriage proof in `build.py`), **`v1.48.17` = `f948be7b` — the
> newest release on that day**, carrying everything below. The current release
> is now `v1.50.2s`; entries that say a change "landed in v1.48.15" or
> `v1.48.17` are historical statements and remain as written.

**Angela, verbatim:** *"Standarize in every ... every dialog and all of the
dialog without exception that if 'Esc' is pressed then the dialog must be
closed with the similar action to 'cancel'/'dismiss' (doing nothing) for every
agent in agentic_control_panel.html for every asset on agent_page.html."*

This REVERSES the 2026-08-13 half of the rule that read *"Escape never closes"*.
The other half is UNTOUCHED: **an outside click still never dismisses.** The
rule is now one line:

> A dialog closes by its titlebar X, its Cancel/dismiss button, its Continue/OK
> button, **or ESCAPE** — and **Escape === X === Cancel**.

**What changed** — `agent/static/agent/js/dialog_policy.js`:

| § | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| 1 jQuery UI | `closeOnEscape = false` | `closeOnEscape = true` |
| 2 native `<dialog>` | a document `cancel` interceptor calling `preventDefault()` | **removed** — `cancel` IS the platform's word for "dismissed" |
| 3 Bootstrap | `keyboard = false` | `keyboard = true` (`backdrop: 'static'` UNCHANGED) |
| 4 hand-rolled overlays | a CAPTURE-phase keydown that SWALLOWED Escape | **the Escape dispatcher** (below) |

**⚠️ THE DISPATCHER NEVER HIDES A NODE.** It finds the topmost open dialog and
**invokes that dialog's own dismiss control** — the click the user would make.
That is why nothing had to be rewired per dialog: the exec-permission prompt
still answers **DENY** through its `close:` handler, `acpConfirm` / `tlmConfirm`
still resolve **false**, every `body.style.overflow` is still restored by the
dialog's own close, and the **sealed updater still refuses**, because its X runs
`CloseUpdateDialog` -> `mayClose('update')`. A blind hide would have silently
skipped all four. (Same reasoning as `checkbox_bulk_toggle.js` clicking a real
checkbox instead of assigning `.checked`.)

**Contracts that must NOT be reverted:**

1. **BUBBLE phase, not capture.** The Catalog's search box clears the query on
   Escape and stops the event there, so the FIRST Escape empties the search and
   only the SECOND closes the catalog. The old capture-phase listener stole both.
2. **`stopImmediatePropagation()` when it dismisses.** Several dialogs bind their
   own Escape handler on `document`. Without it, Escape on a `tlmConfirm` raised
   over the External-MCPs dialog dismisses the confirm AND closes the dialog
   underneath — two layers for one keystroke. This is also why
   `dialog_policy.js` must stay the FIRST document keydown handler on both pages
   (it loads right after jQuery UI, before every dialog module).
3. **It bails when no dialog is open.** Escape still belongs to the page: the ACP
   canvas hides its agent tooltip with it, the avatar stops speaking.
4. **Escape can never press an affirmative button.** The label scan matches only
   cancel / close / dismiss / cancelar / cerrar / no and the × glyphs. A dialog
   with exactly ONE button is an acknowledgement (the parametrizer error box's
   "OK", the starter result's "Continue!") and that button is its way out.
5. **Backdrops are excluded.** `.ui-widget-overlay` also wears
   `.starter-execution-overlay`, so the `-overlay` shape matches it; dismissing a
   backdrop would leave its panel floating over an undimmed page.
6. **A dialog with no X and no Cancel must expose `el.tlmDismiss`.** The Catalog
   of prompts is the one such dialog (`tools_dialog.js`); a blind hide there
   leaves `body.style.overflow: hidden`, i.e. the whole chat page unscrollable
   with nothing on screen to explain why.
7. **The sealed updater is NOT an exception to the rule — it IS the rule.**
   "Escape behaves exactly like X" means that where the X refuses, Escape
   refuses. Interrupting a half-applied update leaves a mixed install directory.

**Two latent defects found on the way** (both invisible while Escape was
swallowed):

* `CUSTOM_OVERLAYS` listed `'#prompts-catalog'`, which is the **BUTTON** that
  opens the Catalog, not an overlay. It is always visible, so
  `aCustomOverlayIsVisible()` returned `true` unconditionally and Escape was in
  fact being swallowed across the WHOLE chat page. The same hand-kept list had
  drifted past six real overlays (`#log-viewer-overlay`,
  `#agent-description-overlay`, `#parametrizer-dialog-overlay`,
  `#parametrizer-error-overlay`, `#flowcreator-progress-overlay`,
  `#chat-img-preview-overlay`). Its replacement is **shape-based**
  (`[id$="-overlay"]`, `[class*="-overlay"]`, `[role="dialog"]`, `.ui-dialog`,
  `.modal.show`, ...) so an overlay written tomorrow is covered with no edit.
* Seven dialogs passed an explicit `closeOnEscape: false` of their own, which
  beats any prototype default — `acp-control-buttons.js` x4, `acp-validate.js`
  x2, `agent_page_dialogs.js` x1. All flipped, and `closeOnEscape [:=] false` is
  now a FORBIDDEN pattern tree-wide.

**Coverage:** `agent/test_dialog_dismissal_policy.py` (23 tests). The forbidden
pattern flipped from `closeOnEscape: true` to `closeOnEscape: false`, and new
tests pin bubble phase, `stopImmediatePropagation`, the no-affirmative-button
rule, backdrop exclusion, the `tlmDismiss` hook, script load ORDER on both
pages, and the themed popup resolving `dismissValue` on Escape. Behaviour is
proven live by
`.claude/skills/tlamatini-daily-chat-test/harness/dialog_policy_visible.py`
(headed Chrome driven by **Playwrighter**, photos by **Shoter**) — which did not
exist before this change, even though the old test docstring already cited it.

### The ONE exception: the updater is INVULNERABLE while it downloads

Angela, same day: *"make the only dialog invulnerable to 'Esc' (MUST IGNORE
EVERY ESCAPE AND CLOSE OF ANY TYPE) ... the Check for updates dialog, while
there is a download in progress"* - and then *"blind it from Ctrl+F4 too"*.

Not a special case bolted onto the dispatcher: a dialog declares
**`el.tlmSealKey`**, and while that key is sealed `dismissDialog()` refuses
before ANY path runs. The updater is simply the first dialog to use it.
`OpenCheckUpdatesDialog` binds `#update-overlay` to `'update'` the moment it
opens (before it is even visible), and `seal(key, message, element)` takes an
optional element so the two can never drift apart.

**Four gaps this closed** - the seal machinery already existed, but:

1. **The seal was checked too late.** `dismissDialog`'s last resort HIDES the
   node. Checked anywhere but first, a sealed dialog whose X was hidden would
   have been hidden by the very fallback meant to help. The test asserts the
   seal check's index is lower than the jQuery close, the click and the hide.
2. **Escape nagged instead of being ignored.** It clicked the X, `mayClose()`
   raised a notice, and that notice became the new topmost dialog - so the next
   Escape dismissed the notice. Now the key is **swallowed** (`preventDefault` +
   `stopImmediatePropagation` BEFORE anything else) and the dialog gets a 600 ms
   CSS shake (`.tlm-dlg-sealed-nudge`). The explanatory notice is kept only for
   a DELIBERATE click on the X.
3. **A failed start sealed the dialog FOREVER.** `StartTlamatiniUpdate` seals
   before POSTing `/agent/start_update/`; the `!data.ok` branch and the `catch`
   both returned WITHOUT unsealing. Nothing was downloading and the user owned a
   dialog that ignored Escape, ignored its X and never went away - strictly
   worse than the interruption the seal exists to prevent. Both paths now unseal.
4. **Only Escape was guarded.** F5 / Ctrl+R destroy the page and the dialog with
   it, and that is the accident a user is far likelier to have.

**⚠️ THE HONEST SPLIT on keys - do not let anyone claim more than this:**

| we really do win | we can NEVER win in a web page |
|---|---|
| F5 · Ctrl+R · Ctrl+Shift+R · Alt+Left/Right · Ctrl+F4 and Ctrl+W *in browsers that deliver them* | Alt+F4 · the window's own X · and in **Chrome** Ctrl+W / Ctrl+Shift+W / Ctrl+F4, which Chrome RESERVES and never delivers to the document |

For the right-hand column the only defence the platform offers is
`beforeunload` (already wired to `anySealed()`), which raises the browser's own
"Leave site?" prompt - and the user may still confirm it. **What makes that
acceptable: the swap runs in an EXTERNAL PowerShell process, so a closed tab
does not abort an update in flight; it only costs the user the progress bar.**
The guard is about preventing an ACCIDENT, not imprisoning anyone.

⚠️ The sealed key guard is **CAPTURE**-phase (nothing may act on a keystroke
aimed at a live update), which is the exact opposite of the Escape dispatcher's
**bubble** phase - and both are pinned, so neither can be "made consistent"
with the other by mistake.

**Proven live:** `chat_14_sealed_update_ignores_escape` opens the real dialog,
seals it, and takes Esc x3 + Ctrl+F4 + Ctrl+W + F5. The dialog is still there
afterwards, and a `window.__tlmSealCanary` proves the page never reloaded -
without it, "the dialog is gone" and "F5 worked" look identical. **The harness
never starts a real update**: `seal('update')` puts the policy in the exact
state `StartTlamatiniUpdate` puts it in, and a test may not download a release
onto Angela's machine. Coverage: 12 more tests in
`agent/test_dialog_dismissal_policy.py` (35 total).

## 2026-08-16 — v1.48.15 target: encoding-safe Grepper, closed verdict vocabulary, and updater preservation

This release target closes four quiet drift paths that could otherwise report a
healthy operation incorrectly or ship an incomplete update:

1. **Grepper is text-encoding aware.** `agent/agents/grepper/grepper.py` detects
   BOM-marked UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32 before trying cp1252/Latin-1 fallbacks.
   Genuine binary files are still skipped. Keep the BOM order: UTF-32 markers
   share prefixes with UTF-16, so testing the shorter marker first corrupts the
   decode. Coverage lives in `agent/test_grepper_encodings.py`.
2. **The Exec Report vocabulary is CLOSED.** `agent_verdict.py` owns five
   pairwise-disjoint sets: `DIAGNOSTIC_COMPLETED_STATUSES`,
   `WORK_COMPLETED_STATUSES`, `WORK_DEGRADED_STATUSES`,
   `WORK_NOT_DONE_STATUSES`, and `AGENT_ERROR_STATUSES`; `KNOWN_STATUSES` is
   their union. Diagnostics and intact work are green. Degraded deliverables,
   work that did not happen, and agent errors are red. R8b remains fail-open
   for unknown tokens at runtime, but `agent/test_status_vocabulary.py`
   statically rejects unknown literals before release. Add a new status to
   exactly ONE shared set; never create a local vocabulary copy.
3. **Numeric process results are not statuses.** Kuberneter now emits
   `returncode: <int>`, `success: <bool>`, and `status: ok|failed`, and its
   Parametrizer contract exposes all three. Never interpolate a numeric return
   code into `status:`: an unrecognized `status: 1` reaches the compatibility
   default instead of expressing failure.
4. **The updater preserves the uninstaller.** The staged-swap policy retains
   `Uninstaller.exe` alongside user state, and parser-sensitive PowerShell
   comments stay on standalone lines. Public release tests now prove the
   catalog is scrubbed/default-only while only the explicit private builder may
   opt into the maintainer catalog. Keep these assertions source-derived so a
   supervisor-name or prompt-rule change cannot make the tests themselves
   stale.

5. **`runtime_provisioner.py` is NAMED in `build.py`, and its carriage is
   PROVEN.** It previously had **no mention in `build.py` at all**, while its
   sibling `external_mcp_defaults.py` was explicitly loaded there. It *did*
   ship — PyInstaller's graph followed `external_mcp_manager.py`'s
   `from . import runtime_provisioner` — but that import lives inside a
   `try/except ImportError` that sets the module to `None`, so carriage rested
   entirely on graph analysis **and the failure mode was SILENT**: drop the
   module and Tlamatini boots perfectly, then simply never provisions
   node/npm/npx/pnpm/uv/uvx again, leaving every `npx -y <pkg>` server dead
   with `[WinError 2]` on exactly the fresh machine the provisioner exists to
   rescue. Two changes: `--hidden-import` now names
   `agent.runtime_provisioner`, `agent.external_mcp_defaults`,
   `agent.external_mcp_manager` and `agent.agent_verdict`; and
   **`verify_frozen_agent_modules()`** runs on the successful-build path,
   opening the archive the build just produced and ABORTING if any of the seven
   `_FROZEN_REQUIRED_AGENT_MODULES` is absent. ⚠️ **The PYZ is NOT a loose
   `_internal/PYZ-00.pyz`** under PyInstaller 6 onedir — it is an entry named
   `PYZ.pyz` inside the executable's CArchive, so the reader uses
   `CArchiveReader` on the `.exe`; a glob for `PYZ-*.pyz` finds nothing and
   would have reported "cannot verify" forever, i.e. a check that never fails
   and never proves anything. Measured against the shipped install: CArchive =
   21 entries, PYZ = 15,075 modules, all 7 required modules PRESENT (confirmed
   independently by a raw byte scan of `Tlamatini.exe`). Guarded by
   `agent/test_runtime_provisioner.py::WiringContractTests`.
6. **The last nine native browser pop-ups are gone.** `contacts_dialog.js` (2)
   and `external_mcps_dialog.js` (7) still called `alert()` / `confirm()` long
   after every other dialog wore the theme — the two NEWEST dialogs were the
   last two raising a grey Windows/Chrome strip with the page URL in it, in the
   middle of a dark themed app. `dialog_policy.js` now exports **`tlmAlert`** /
   **`tlmConfirm`**, the chat-page counterparts of the canvas's
   `acpAlert`/`acpConfirm` (2026-08-12), styled from the existing
   `dialog_theme.css` tokens (`.tlmpop-*`). ⚠️ **They are NOT jQuery-UI
   dialogs, and the z-index is load-bearing**: these popups are raised BY
   native modals at `z-index: 20000` (`.emx-dialog` / `.ctb-dialog`), while
   `.ui-front` sits at ~100 — a confirm rendered *underneath* the dialog that
   asked for it is an invisible modal, i.e. a hang. The overlay is at
   **100001**, above every layer the app defines. Both are Promise-based, so
   each call site moved its action into the callback; `removeContact` also
   re-resolves the contact by identity because the list may re-render while the
   popup is open. Policy-compliant by construction (host listed in
   `CUSTOM_OVERLAYS`, outside click swallowed, X === Cancel === `false`) and
   **fail-open** to the native popup — a lost warning is worse than an ugly
   one. Guarded by
   `agent/test_dialog_dismissal_policy.py::NoNativePopupSurvivesInThemedDialogsTests`;
   add a newly-migrated module to `_THEMED_DIALOG_MODULES` there.

7. **Five RED tests that were not bugs in the code they guarded.** A full
   `manage.py test agent` run was `4350 tests, FAILED (failures=5)`, and every
   one was the TEST being wrong about its own subject. Recorded because each is
   a distinct, recurring failure MODE:
   * **A hand-typed count rots.** `test_external_mcp_e2e` listed the eight
     supervisor tool names literally; the Runtime Provisioner added
     `external_mcp_runtime_status` / `_runtime_install` and the healthy code
     went red. Now DERIVED from `em._SUPERVISOR_TOOL_NAMES` — it still catches
     a declared-but-unbuilt supervisor and can never go stale on a count. Same
     rot that pinned "eight supervisor tools" into the prose.
   * **A pinned SENTENCE rots when the message improves.** `test_pdfer_agent`
     required the words `'not writable'`; the OneDrive fix had rewritten the
     blocker to *"output_dir cannot accept a new file (…)"* — strictly better,
     because "the directory exists" and `os.access` both LIE and only a real
     create proves anything. It now asserts the blocker NAMES `output_dir` (the
     contract: the user must know which knob to turn), not the prose.
   * **Testing the wrong ARTIFACT.** `test_zavuerer_agent` asks "is a REAL
     credential COMMITTED?" but read the WORKING TREE — where
     `regen_secrets.py --mode keyed` puts Angela's real key ON PURPOSE. It cried
     wolf on the one machine where the key belongs. Now reads
     `git show HEAD:<path>` (fail-open to the working tree with no git), so it
     guards the push, which is the only place a leak can happen.
   * **A fixed sleep is a race, not a wait.** `test_watchdog_foreground_exemption`
     slept 1.5 s then asserted the watchdog spares a VISIBLE console. Under the
     full suite (with Ollama and a headed Chrome running) the window sometimes
     was not up yet, so EnumWindows saw nothing, the process was CORRECTLY
     judged headless, and it was reaped — a red about scheduling, not about the
     watchdog (proved by 28/28 OK twice in isolation). Now `_await_visible()`
     polls until the precondition actually holds and fails with a message
     saying so if it never does.
   * **One REAL defect.** LaTeXer's `_mapToolArgsToAgentConfig` branch never
     mapped `input_text_b64` / `content_b64` / `find_text_b64` /
     `replace_text_b64`, so a generated `.flw` silently dropped the only copy of
     the source that had survived transport intact — exactly the `\\`
     row-break loss the verbatim channel exists to prevent. Now mapped.

   **The lesson to carry:** when a test goes red, ask FIRST whether it is still
   testing what it claims to. Derive counts, assert contracts instead of
   sentences, test the artifact the risk actually lives in, and WAIT for a
   precondition rather than sleeping and hoping.

These behaviors build on, rather than replace, the v1.48.14 private External-MCP
runtime/default-seeding and public/private catalog boundary below.

## 2026-08-15 — Runtime Provisioner: Tlamatini ALWAYS has npx/uvx, and two MCPs ship by default

**Angela's directive:** ship `@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory` and
`@modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking` in **every** installation,
both **INACTIVE** — and give Tlamatini a *perfect, always-available*
npm/pnpm/uv/uvx/npx **without carrying them in the installer** the way Python
and the JRE are carried.

**The hole this closes.** The External MCP ecosystem is overwhelmingly
`npx -y <pkg>` or `uvx <pkg>`. A fresh Windows box has NONE of those, so a
brand-new install that ticked `memory` got a silent
`[WinError 2] The system cannot find the file specified`: the catalog entry was
perfect, the runtime simply did not exist. Tlamatini's own design note for these
two servers even listed "node v24, npm, npx, pnpm, uv, uvx — all detected" as a
system fact; that was true of the DEV machine and of nobody else.

### New: `agent/runtime_provisioner.py` — a PRIVATE, self-provisioning toolchain

Same pattern Angela already proved three times (Discoverer's private Go,
ESP32er's PlatformIO, Arduiner's arduino-cli): download once, on demand, from
the OFFICIAL upstream into **`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Tlamatini\runtimes`** — never the
install dir (a self-update replaces it wholesale, and Program Files may be
read-only), never a system location, **no admin, no system PATH change**.

**FIVE CONTRACTS — do NOT weaken any of them:**

1. **FAIL-OPEN, ALWAYS.** Every public function is total. `resolve()` returns
   `""` and life goes on. A provisioner that can break the chat path is
   infinitely worse than a missing `npx`.
2. **NEVER BLOCK STARTUP.** `provision_async()` is a pure no-op (one resolve,
   zero network, **no thread started**) once the runtimes are present —
   measured at 0.000 s. Downloads only ever happen on a background thread.
3. **ATOMIC OR ABSENT.** Download → Temp, verify, unpack to `<dest>.partial-<pid>`,
   then `os.replace`. A half-extracted tree that merely *looks* installed would
   poison every later run, so it is structurally impossible.
4. **VERIFY WHAT UPSTREAM SIGNS.** Node's `SHASUMS256.txt` is fetched and
   ENFORCED; uv's `.sha256` sidecar likewise. `runtime_require_checksum: true`
   refuses anything unverifiable.
5. **SPAWN WITHOUT A SHELL.** ⚠️ On Windows `npx` is a `.cmd` batch shim that
   `CreateProcess` cannot execute — the single most common cause of broken
   npx-launched MCP servers. `resolve_spawn()` rewrites `npx` to
   **`node.exe <npx-cli.js>`**, the real program behind the shim. It also sees
   through a `cmd /c npx …` wrapper. **Do NOT "simplify" this back to
   `shutil.which('npx')`.**

**A system install WINS.** Resolution is: explicit `<tool>_executable` config →
Tlamatini's private runtime → system PATH → well-known per-user locations. We
only ever FILL A HOLE; we never shadow the user's own toolchain (our runtime
only exists if we installed it, and we only install what was missing).

### New: `agent/external_mcp_defaults.py` — the two shipped servers

⚠️ **Defaults live in CODE, not only in the shipped JSON — this is load-bearing.**
`external_mcps.json` is USER STATE that `apply_update.ps1` **preserves**, so a
default written only into the file `build.py` ships would reach fresh installs
and **nobody else**. `load_catalog()` seeds from code on the READ path
(`_seed_defaults_once`, one write per process), which reaches every install on
every launch, through every entry point.

**TOMBSTONE CONTRACT:** if the user DELETES a default it must STAY deleted —
`remove_servers` records it in `_removed_defaults` and the seeder skips it. A
Remove button that silently undoes itself is a bug. An explicit re-import clears
the tombstone. A default the user EDITED is never overwritten.

Both seed **INACTIVE**: activating spawns a child and burns one of the five
slots — the user's decision, never ours. `build.py` now writes the shipped
catalog from `shipped_catalog_document()` (same module → the file and the seeder
can never drift), and still ships **no** maintainer secrets.

### Wiring

- `_StdioMcpClient.__init__` starts from `runtime_provisioner.augment_env()`
  (private bins on PATH + quiet npm flags, so a first run can't hang on an
  update notice or a corepack prompt).
- `_StdioMcpClient._resolve_argv` delegates to `resolve_spawn`.
- `_connect` calls `_ensure_runtime_for_spec` for stdio servers — **the moment
  that makes it "just work"**: tick `memory` on a Node-less box and Node is
  downloaded right there, on the background connect thread.
- `_which_executable` + the **MCP Doctor pool agent** are runtime-aware. A
  missing-but-**provisionable** manager is deliberately **NOT a blocker** and the
  `next_step` says Tlamatini installs it herself — telling the user to go install
  Node would be wrong advice. A genuinely missing binary still blocks (no false
  calm). The doctor mirrors the layout inline because a pool agent cannot import
  `agent.*`; **keep the mirror in sync with `runtimes_root()`**.
- Two new LLM tools: `external_mcp_runtime_status` / `external_mcp_runtime_install`
  (registered in `_SUPERVISOR_TOOL_NAMES` **and** built in `_build_supervisor_tools`).
- `GET /agent/external_mcps/` carries a `runtime` block; `POST
  /agent/external_mcps/runtime_install/` backs the dialog's "Install now" button
  (`.emx-runtime*` strip in `external_mcps_dialog.js`/`.css`).
- `apps.ready()` pre-warms in the background and seeds the catalog.

Config: `runtime_autoprovision` (default **true**), `runtime_install_dir`,
`runtime_provision_tools`, `runtime_download_timeout_seconds`,
`runtime_require_checksum`, `node_version`, and `<tool>_executable` overrides.
Env: `TLAMATINI_RUNTIMES`, `TLAMATINI_RUNTIME_AUTOPROVISION`.

**Proven end-to-end on a simulated fresh machine** (not mocked): with an empty
runtime root and the system PATH stripped to bare Windows, Node 24.19.0 and uv
0.12.5 were downloaded + **sha256-verified** in 7 s, and the real
`@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory 0.6.3` completed an MCP
`initialize` + `tools/list` handshake exposing exactly its **9 tools**.

### The catalog is now TRACKED in git — and CANNOT leak

Angela's follow-up call the same day: **`Tlamatini/agent/external_mcps.json` is no
longer gitignored**, so the repo SHOWS every External MCP server Tlamatini knows
about. That file held a live GitHub PAT and a live Snyk key, so tracking it
required the same machinery `config.json` already uses:

- **`regen_secrets.py` now patches the catalog too** (`patch_external_mcps_json`,
  wired into `main()`). `--mode push-able` replaces every secret `env` value with
  `<NAME goes here>`; `--mode keyed` restores the real values from `data.keys`.
  **Run push-able BEFORE ANY PUSH**, exactly as for `config.json`. Both existing
  keys were vaulted as `OCTOCODE_GITHUB_TOKEN` / `SNYK_API_KEY`.
- ⚠️ **LOSSLESS CONTRACT — do NOT weaken.** `push-able` **AUTO-VAULTS** anything it
  is about to redact into `data.keys` *first*, under a derived
  `EXTMCP_<SERVER>_<FIELD>` name. That is what makes the round trip safe for a
  server the rule table has never heard of: scrub → push → `keyed` brings it back.
  A scrub that silently destroyed an unrecognised token would be far worse than
  the leak it prevents.
- ⚠️ **A LOCATION IS NOT A CREDENTIAL.** `_NEVER_SECRET_FIELD_PARTS` (path, file,
  dir, url, host, port, …) **wins over** `_SECRETISH_FIELD_PARTS`, and `"pat"` was
  REMOVED from the latter. Caught live: `MEMORY_FILE_PATH` contains "PAT", so the
  memory server's storage path was scrubbed to a placeholder and vaulted — and
  `keyed` would then have stamped the build machine's own path onto someone
  else's install. Pinned by `test_a_location_is_never_treated_as_a_secret`.

**Two build flavours** (`build.py`, "Ship external_mcps.json"):

| build | catalog shipped |
|---|---|
| **PUBLIC** (bare `build.py`, `build_complete_public_release.py`) | ONLY `memory` + `sequential-thinking`, generated from `external_mcp_defaults.shipped_catalog_document()`. No maintainer server, no secret, ever. |
| **PRIVATE / KEYED** (`build_complete_private_release.py`) | EVERY dev server **plus** the two defaults merged in, via `TLAMATINI_BUNDLE_EXTERNAL_MCPS` (mirrors `TLAMATINI_BUNDLE_CONTACTS`). Runs after `--mode keyed`, so real tokens are in place. |

The public builder **CLEARS** that env var, and `build.py` carries a hard
**SystemExit seatbelt**: a PUBLIC build that would ship a live-looking secret
ABORTS rather than repeating the pre-2026-08-12 leak. Tombstones are dropped in
the private path so a keyed build ships both defaults even if the dev deleted one.

Verified by a real round trip on the live keys (scrub → nothing survives in the
file → restore byte-for-byte) plus both build flavours.
Coverage: `agent/test_runtime_provisioner.py` (**44 tests**).

## 2026-08-15 — v1.48.13 release baseline: guarded placement, uniform dialogs, coherent long operations

- **Mover/Deleter placement:** empty, relative, and legacy `C:/Temp/...` scratch destinations resolve under `TLAMATINI_TEMP` / `<app>/Temp`; an explicit absolute user destination remains authoritative; Deleter normalization never broadens pattern, parent, or recursion.
- **Uniform frontend:** `dialog_theme.css` defines the visual language across jQuery UI, Bootstrap, and custom overlays. `dialog_policy.js` owns fail-open dismissal semantics; outside click and Escape do not close guarded dialogs, titlebar X means Cancel, and sealed updater work may block dismissal.
- **Long operations:** `agent_page_ui.js::LONG_OPERATION_DISABLED_MENU_BUTTONS` is the one menu-lock list. Disable/enable paths are mirrored and preserve/restore `data-bs-toggle`; only Check for Updates and Configure Agents receive the additional targeted lock.
- **Updater and auditability:** `release_notes_renderer.js` safely renders release text; `agent/log_identity.py` and its middleware/consumer integrations attribute application output by user, request, stream, and source line.
- **Do not regress:** JavaScript/CSS/template changes require `STATIC_VERSION`; verify movement guard tests, frontend lint/tests, source/collected-static parity, and release dossier coverage together.

---

## 2026-08-13 — `tlamatini.log` could not say WHICH user a line belonged to when two people were connected (`agent/log_identity.py`, `manage.py`, `consumers.py`, `tlamatini/middleware.py`)

**Symptom (Angela).** Tlamatini happily serves two logged-in sessions at once on
the same machine — `angela` in one browser, `alice` in another. But
`tlamatini.log` interleaved both users' work into one undifferentiated stream:
a Multi-Turn burst from alice and a RAG rebuild for angela looked identical, and
nothing on the line said whose request produced it.

**Why it was not just "add the username to the formatter".** Three reasons.
(1) Most of Tlamatini's log output is `print()`, not `logging` — a
`logging.Formatter` would miss the majority of lines, and third-party stdout
entirely. The only universal choke point is `manage.py`'s `_TeeStream.write`.
(2) The obvious identity carrier, `threading.local`, is **wrong here**: ONE
event-loop thread serves EVERY connected user, so a thread-local smears angela's
identity over alice's coroutine. (3) Angela's two explicit constraints — minimal
characters in the file, minimal CPU per line — rule out formatting anything
per line.

**The fix.** `agent/log_identity.py` keeps a `contextvars.ContextVar` holding a
**pre-rendered, ready-to-write** prefix (`'[a3] '` = user `a`, turn 3). The tee
does one `ContextVar.get()` and one concatenation; nothing is formatted per
line, and lines that belong to no user get **no prefix at all**. `bind()` /
`begin_turn()` are called from `consumers.py` (connect / receive /
queue_llm_retrieval) and from the new `UserLogTagMiddleware` for HTTP. A
one-time `--- [WHO] a = angela (user id 1)` legend makes the 5-character tag
self-describing. `config.json` knobs: `log_user_tags`, `log_user_tag_style`
(`short` | `name` | `off`), `log_user_tag_thread_inherit`.

**Contracts — do NOT revert these:**

* **The tee must never `import agent.*`.** It runs BEFORE Django exists, and
  `agent/__init__` pulls protobuf/gRPC. Coupling is inverted on purpose:
  `manage.py` exposes an empty `_USER_TAG_HOOK = None` slot and
  `log_identity.install()` fills it in at app boot. A launch without the module
  writes untagged lines instead of failing.
* **`data` is never reassigned inside `write()`** — the tagged text goes to
  `payload`, so the return value stays the number of characters the CALLER
  passed. A `write()` that claims it wrote more than it was given lies to any
  caller that loops on partial writes.
* **`_at_line_start` must survive across calls.** `print()` writes the text and
  its newline as TWO separate `write()` calls; without that state the second
  call would emit a second tag on the same line.
* **The BOM-style ordering trap has an analogue here:** a chunk that is only a
  newline is left BARE. Tagging blank lines spends characters on nothing.
* **`ContextVar`, not `threading.local`** (see above), and `install()` wraps
  `Thread.start` with `contextvars.copy_context()` so raw threads (self-healing
  watchdog, Tier-2 reaper, agent launchers) inherit the tag — that is what makes
  the attribution total rather than merely usual.
* **FAIL-OPEN everywhere**, ASCII-only prefix (the tee also writes to a cp1252
  console), stdlib-only module.

Coverage: `agent/test_log_identity.py` (27 tests, incl. two users in two
contexts never seeing each other's tag, and a hook that raises never breaking a
write).

## 2026-08-09 — pip's "A new release of pip is available" nag on EVERY `build_complete_*` run: suppress the CHECK, do NOT chase the upgrade

**Symptom (Angela).** Every single run of `build_complete_public_release.py` /
`build_complete_private_release.py` printed, mid-build:

```
[notice] A new release of pip is available: 25.0.1 -> 26.2
[notice] To update, run: python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

and it **came back after she manually upgraded pip** — which is what made it feel unfixable.

**Root cause — there are TWO pips, and the upgrade went to the wrong one.**
Measured live on this machine:

| interpreter | pip | prefix |
|---|---|---|
| `C:/Program Files/Python312/python.exe` ← **what the build uses** | **25.0.1** | READ-ONLY (Program Files) — `--upgrade pip` needs admin |
| `<repo>/python` (the carried Python) | **26.2.1** ✅ | writable — this is the one that got upgraded |

So the manual upgrade was real, it just landed on a different interpreter. And even a
*successful* upgrade of the build pip would only buy silence **until pip's next release** —
"keep pip current" is a treadmill, not a fix. Note the notice is emitted after an
already-satisfied `pip install -r requirements.txt` too, which is why it appeared on every
build regardless of whether anything was installed.

**Fix — disable the CHECK, in two layers (do NOT strip either).**

1. **Environment pin** `PIP_DISABLE_PIP_VERSION_CHECK=1` in all five build scripts, so
   **every child *and grandchild* pip inherits it** — including pips we do not spawn
   directly. In `build.py` / `build_installer.py` / `build_uninstaller.py` it is a
   module-level `os.environ[...]`; in the two `build_complete_*` wrappers it is set inside
   **`_utf8_env()`**, which is the single env every child process of the wrapper gets.
2. **Explicit `--disable-pip-version-check`** on all 8 direct pip commands
   (`build.py` ×6, `build_installer.py` ×1, `build_uninstaller.py` ×1), placed **before the
   subcommand** (`-m pip --disable-pip-version-check install ...` — verified live that pip
   accepts it there). Belt-and-braces: the silence survives a refactor that rebuilds `env`
   from scratch.

**⚠️ E402 trap:** the `os.environ[...]` pin **must sit AFTER the `from versioning import ...`
block**. Ruff's default rule set includes E4, so a bare statement placed *between* imports
trips `E402 module level import not at top of file` on the import that follows it.
(Same class of trap as the pool agents' `TLAMATINI_TEMP` guard, which is written as an
`if`-block for exactly this reason.)

**Explicitly NOT done:** the build does not run `pip install --upgrade pip`. That needs admin
on a Program Files prefix, adds a network round-trip to an already ~18-minute build, and
solves nothing durably. `test_no_pip_upgrade_treadmill_in_the_build` fails if someone adds it.

**Coverage:** `Tlamatini/agent/test_build_pip_quiet.py` (4 tests, AST-based so it cannot be
fooled by reformatting) pins both layers in both directions and fails if a build script is
renamed out of the guard's reach. It **skips** when the repo-root build scripts are absent
(frozen/packaged tree) — fail-open.

**Live proof (2026-08-09, visible window, log `Temp/pip_nag_fix_verify.log`):** control run
with no fix reproduced the notice verbatim; the same command with **only the CLI flag**, and
again with **only the env var**, printed **no notice**, exit 0 in all three. Ruff clean,
`py_compile` clean, guard test 4/4 OK.

**Scope note:** this covers the BUILD pipeline only. The pool agents that pip-install at
runtime (ESPHomer `pip install esphome`, STM32er `mcp`/`pyserial`, ESP32er's PlatformIO
bootstrap) can still surface the notice in their own agent logs — deliberately left alone
rather than touching mission-critical agents for a cosmetic line.

---

## 2026-08-08 (same day, follow-up) — the self-modify gate was never WIRED: `apply_self_knowledge_blocks` existed, was tested, and was called by nobody (`rag/config.py`)

**Found by running the suite, in BOTH trees.** `agent/test_self_modify_gate.py`
shipped 28 tests; **6 of them failed identically in Tlamatini and in
Tlamatini-Spanish** — `test_no_marker_ever_leaks_into_the_prompt`,
`test_default_mode_drops_the_entire_self_knowledge_section`,
`test_self_modify_mode_keeps_her_exactly_as_before`,
`test_default_mode_prompt_is_smaller`, `test_exactly_one_alternative_survives`,
`test_real_checkout_is_self_consistent`. The code contradicted its own test
suite, so this was unfinished wiring, not a design choice.

**What was wrong.** `apply_self_knowledge_blocks(prompt, self_able)` was written,
documented and covered — but `load_config_and_prompt` never called it. Only the
*second* layer worked (`_load_self_knowledge_block` returning the short notice),
which is why the big saving still showed up and hid the hole. Consequences:
the literal `<!--SELF_KNOWLEDGE_BEGIN-->` sentinels **leaked into the system
prompt the model actually reads**, and **BOTH alternatives survived** — she was
told she carries her full self-knowledge *and*, two lines later, that she
carries none.

**The fix.** Two lines at the single prompt-load site:

```python
prompt_template = apply_self_knowledge_blocks(
    prompt_template, is_self_able_modify(application_path))
```

**⚠️ ORDER MATTERS — do NOT move it below the placeholder replacement.** The
block resolution must run FIRST: in a not-self-able-modify build it deletes the
whole `<self_knowledge>` section *including* the `{self_knowledge}` placeholder,
so the injection below correctly finds nothing. Reversed, the file would be
injected into a block that is about to be deleted, and the markers would leak
exactly as before. Both trees now pass: 28/28 English, 61/61 Spanish
(28 + the Spanish sync guards).

---

## 2026-08-08 — `--self-modify` only worked HALF way: a not-self-able-modify build still carried her ENTIRE self-description in every prompt (`rag/config.py`, `prompt.pmt`, `build.py`, `build_complete_private_release.py`)

**The demand (Angela).** Verify that without `--self-modify` (a) the source code is not copied into the zip, and (b) the context about herself is not injected into `prompt.pmt` at runtime — *"no matter Tlamatini does not understand too much about her"*. Then: **the goal is to reduce the context size and the token intake in the default mode**, and *"if `--self-modify` is selected then let Tlamatini like it was with all about herself in order to modify herself"*. Plus: **`build_complete_*` must default as if `--no-self-modify` were set.**

**What was verified as CORRECT.** The source tree really was gated: `build.py` generates `TlamatiniSourceCode/` only inside `if self_modify:`, no `--add-data` carries it, `build_installer.py` never mentions it, PyInstaller runs with `--noconfirm` (so `dist/manage` is wiped each build and a stale tree from an earlier self-modify build cannot survive into `pkg.zip`), and the repo holds no static copy.

**What was BROKEN — the other half.** `Tlamatini.md` shipped **unconditionally**: an `--add-data` bundle entry AND an install-root `optional_file_copies` copy. And `rag/config.py` injected it whenever the `{self_knowledge}` placeholder existed — it checked **nothing** about self-modify. So a "not-self-able-modify" build paid for her full self-description on **every single request**, and `prompt.pmt` even told her to "work from your injected self-knowledge" when the source tree was absent — a sentence that was only true by accident.

**The fix — one XOR, resolved at the single prompt-load site.**

- **Runtime**: the ENTIRE `<self_knowledge>` section — its two long identity bullets AND the injected file — is sentinel-wrapped (`<!--SELF_KNOWLEDGE_BEGIN/END-->`), and a short honest alternative is wrapped in `<!--NOT_SELF_MODIFY_BEGIN/END-->`. `load_config_and_prompt` resolves the XOR through the **pre-existing** `_resolve_rule_block` machinery (the same one that gates the ACPX Rule 12 and Templates Rule 16 blocks) before touching the placeholder. `is_self_able_modify(application_path)` — `TlamatiniSourceCode/` beside `prompt.pmt` — is the single runtime marker, and it **fails CLOSED** (no source ⇒ no claim of self-modification).
- **Packaging**: `Tlamatini.md` is now bundled and copied ONLY under `--self-modify`, in lockstep with the source tree. `--no-self-modify` became a REAL flag that **wins** over `--self-modify`.
- **Wrappers**: `build_complete_private_release.py` flipped from opt-OUT to opt-IN (`--self-modify`, default off; `--no-self-modify` kept as an accepted no-op). `build_complete_public_release.py` was already opt-in.

**Measured result** (real loader, real files, printed by the test): the system prompt goes from **138,225 → 75,371 chars — 62,854 chars saved, ≈15,700 tokens off EVERY request**, a ~45 % smaller system prompt in the default mode.

**Contracts that must NOT be weakened:**

- **Source and self-knowledge ship TOGETHER, or not at all.** Re-adding an unconditional `Tlamatini.md` copy silently restores the whole cost.
- **With `--self-modify` nothing changed.** The kept block is byte-identical to what she always had, so she can still read, modify and rebuild herself. Do not "simplify" the kept branch.
- **The placeholder must NEVER survive** either branch: a leftover `{self_knowledge}` becomes an unexpected `ChatPromptTemplate` input variable and breaks every chain. A legacy `prompt.pmt` with the placeholder but no sentinels still degrades safely (second layer: `_load_self_knowledge_block` returns `NOT_SELF_ABLE_MODIFY_NOTICE`).
- **The fallback line stays SHORT.** It exists to be cheap; a test fails if it grows past 800 chars.
- `is_self_able_modify` fails **closed**, the block resolution fails **open** (a prompt without markers is left untouched).

Coverage: `agent/test_self_modify_gate.py` (25 tests — block XOR, marker leakage, the measured saving, packaging AST gates, wrapper defaults, prompt.pmt structure). Suite run: 129 tests OK, ruff clean.

## 2026-08-06 — The Exec Report judged every agent by its EXIT CODE, so a tool that worked could be stamped FAILURE (`agent_verdict.py`, `tools.py`, `mcp_agent.py`)

**The demand (Angela).** If the execution really succeeded, the table must say **SUCCESS**. If the execution really errored and did not do the designated task at all, the table must say **FAILED**. Both directions, every agent, no exceptions.

**What was wrong — two different questions were collapsed into one string.**

| | question | answer lives in |
|---|---|---|
| PROCESS | "did the child exit 0?" | the exit code — **one bit** |
| AGENT | "did the agent do the job, and what did it FIND?" | its `INI_SECTION` self-report — **a typed record** |

`tools._launch_wrapped_chat_agent` set `payload["status"]` from the exit code, and `_maybe_promote_section_fields_to_payload` then tried to lift the agent's own `status:` in with **`payload.setdefault(key, value)`** — which, on the one key that mattered most, was a **silent NO-OP**. The agent's truthful self-report was **discarded** and the crude exit-code verdict survived all the way into `_result_is_failure` → `call_success` → the Exec-Report row. Worse, `mcp_agent._DIAGNOSTIC_COMPLETED_STATUSES` had been written to prevent exactly this — but it tested a value that had *already* been overwritten with `"failed"` upstream, so it was **unreachable dead code**.

**The fix — a deterministic verdict engine, `agent/agent_verdict.py`.** A lexer/parser turns the agent's self-report into a typed AST (`SectionNode` → `KVNode` → coerced values), and an ordered production-rule table decides:

| rule | fires on | verdict |
|---|---|---|
| R1 | no self-report at all | the exit code |
| R2 | the agent declares `error` / `failed` | **FAILED** |
| R3 | `refused` / `not_found` / `not_unique` / `engine_unavailable` … — the work did NOT happen | **FAILED** |
| R4 | a read-only diagnostic ran to completion (`invalid`, `findings`, `no_matches`, `listed` …) | **SUCCESS** |
| R5 | an explicit `success:` / `ok:` boolean | that boolean |
| R6 | a non-zero `errors:` count (`"0"` is **not** a failure) | **FAILED** |
| R7 | nothing decisive + non-zero exit | **FAILED** |
| R8 | no failure signal found | **SUCCESS** |

**ORDER IS THE ALGORITHM, and R4 MUST outrank R5 and R6.** A linter that worked perfectly reports `status: invalid` **and** `success: False` **and** `errors: 2` in the same breath — the last two describe the **document**, not the agent. Testing them before R4 is precisely the bug this engine was written to kill.

**Contract (do NOT weaken).**

* The agent's own self-report **OUTRANKS** the process exit code. An exit code is one bit; the self-report is a typed record.
* A self-report is **NEVER** dropped or overwritten. On a key collision the process view stays under `<key>` and the agent view lands on `agent_<key>` — **both** survive. Never collapse them back into one key.
* A **read-only diagnostic that reports an adverse finding has SUCCEEDED** — the finding is the DELIVERABLE. A red row must mean *"the tool malfunctioned"*, never *"the tool found something"*.
* **FAIL-OPEN**: every parse/coercion error resolves to "no opinion" and falls through to the next rule. Nothing in here may raise into a caller — a verdict engine that can break the chat path is worse than the mislabelled row it fixes.
* **100% DETERMINISTIC** — no model call, no heuristics. A probabilistic verdict engine could not be trusted to say whether something failed, and would cost a round-trip on every tool call. The agents already emit a precise machine-readable self-report; the only thing missing was somebody actually READING it.
* `mcp_agent._result_is_failure` honours the engine **only when `verdict.source == "agent"`**; every other case falls through to the legacy classifier, so ACPX / External-MCP / plain-text envelopes are untouched (`{"ok": false}` still goes red).
* Stdlib only, and it imports nothing from `agent.*` — so it can never create an import cycle between `tools.py` and `mcp_agent.py` (both import it), and behaves identically frozen and from source.
* **Historical v1.48.2 form:** the status vocabulary had one diagnostic-completion set. The v1.48.15 contract at the top of this log supersedes that shape with five disjoint sets and `KNOWN_STATUSES`; the invariant that `mcp_agent` aliases rather than copies the shared definitions remains unchanged.

Pinned by `agent/test_agent_verdict.py` (25 tests: the parser, every rule, rule ORDER, auditable provenance, totality-never-raises, both call sites, the single-vocabulary contract, and the live STEP-4 payload end-to-end). `agent.test_agent_verdict` + `agent.test_latexer_agent` = **125 passing**, ruff clean.

## 2026-08-06 — LaTeXer's `validate_tex` reported a red **FAILURE** for a lint that worked perfectly (`agents/latexer/latexer.py`)

**Live symptom (Angela, frozen install at `C:\Tlamatini`, LaTeXer step-by-step wizard, STEP 4).** The wizard deliberately lints a fragment with an unclosed `itemize`. LaTeXer found the bug exactly as designed — correct error, correct line number, correct explanation — and then the **Exec Report printed a red `FAILURE`** over that row. In `tlamatini.log`: `status = failed`, `exit_code: 1`, next to `"errors": "1"`.

**Root cause — the AGENT verdict was tied to the DOCUMENT verdict.** The `validate_tex` branch did:

```python
ok = report["ok"]                                   # ← the DOCUMENT's cleanliness
outcome["status"] = "validated" if ok else "invalid"
outcome["success"] = ok
```

`ok` then feeds the deliberate `sys.exit(0 if ok else 1)` at the tail of `main()`, the wrapped chat-agent runtime derives `completed` / `failed` from that exit code, and the Exec Report renders that verdict. So **a linter that successfully caught a bug was reported to the user as a failed run.** `validate_tex` was the only outlier: its own read-only siblings `structure` / `read_file` / `list_files` all set `ok = True` unconditionally.

**Fix.** `ok = True` for `validate_tex`; the document verdict stays fully truthful in `status` (`validated` / `invalid`) and in `errors` / `warnings` — which is what a downstream Forker actually branches on. Verified live: the same broken input now returns `return_code: 0` **and** `errors: 1`, `status: invalid`.

**The contract (do NOT re-tie them).** `ok` means *"the AGENT did the job it was asked to do"*, **NOT** *"the user's document is clean"*. A read-only linter finding problems is a **SUCCESS**, exactly like Grepper finding matches or Analyzer reporting `findings`. Only actions that **failed to do the requested work** may exit non-zero — `refused`, `not_found`, `not_unique`, `engine_unavailable`, and a build that produced no PDF or a mis-typeset one (`compiled_with_errors`). Those stay non-zero on purpose; that half of the 2026-08-05 truthful-exit-code fix is unchanged.

Pinned by `agent/test_latexer_agent.py::test_validate_tex_finding_errors_is_a_SUCCESSFUL_run_REGRESSION_2026_08_06` (asserts the source no longer contains `ok = report["ok"]`, that the `validated` / `invalid` distinction survives, and behaviourally that the linter still finds the unclosed environment). The older `test_exit_code_is_truthful_REGRESSION_2026_08_05` still passes — its `sys.exit(0 if ok else 1)` assertion is untouched; only its docstring was narrowed to drop the now-wrong "an `invalid` lint" example.

## 2026-08-05 — Executer's forked window was INVISIBLE; a ShowWindow rescue fixed it (`agents/executer/executer.py`)

**What was wrong.** `execute_forked_window: true` produced **no window Angela could see** when the agent ran under the session MCP host — while the log cheerfully printed `window=visible`. The script really ran (its log was written), so the failure was silent. Proved with Tlamatini's own tools: **Windower scanned the desktop twice and found no such window.**

**What did NOT work (measured — do not retry).** Creation flags cannot fix it: neither `Start-Process -WindowStyle Normal` (the shipped path) nor a direct `Popen` with `CREATE_NEW_CONSOLE | CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP | CREATE_BREAKAWAY_FROM_JOB` made the window appear. That experimental edit was reverted rather than left in with a false "this fixes it" comment.

**What DID work.** Flags only control window *creation* — the console **already existed and had simply never been SHOWN**. So the fix forces it out afterwards:

- `_console_window_snapshot()` records every console-class window **before** the launch. (Console windows belong to `conhost.exe`, **not** to the `cmd.exe` we spawn, so `GetWindowThreadProcessId` reports a PID we never saw — diffing snapshots is the only reliable identification.)
- `_force_show_new_consoles()` diffs afterwards and forces each NEW window visible with `ShowWindow(SW_SHOWNORMAL/SW_SHOW)` + `BringWindowToTop` + `SetForegroundWindow`.
- Wired into **both** the non-blocking path and `_execute_in_forked_window` (daemon thread there, since that path blocks). Stdlib `ctypes` only — it is a pool agent.

**Measured delta, same tool both times:** before, Windower found **no window**; after, it **finds, focuses and maximizes** it (`hwnd=0x00280292`). **Angela then confirmed she SAW it on screen** — real pixels, not just a handle.

**DO NOT weaken these:**
- **It runs AFTER the script is already launched**, so it can never affect whether the user's work executes. A rescue that breaks execution is worse than an invisible window.
- **It NEVER relaunches to obtain a window** — that would run the user's work twice (double writes, double test runs).
- **It reports only what SURVIVES verification.** The first version announced "window is visible" the instant it saw any new console — including short-lived ones from our own launcher — which reproduced the very lie being removed. It now settles, re-checks `IsWindow`+`IsWindowVisible`, and counts only survivors.
- **The log under-claims on purpose**: `window=visible REQUESTED + rescue attempted (NOT guaranteed — confirm with the Windower agent)`. Proven for this host, not promised for every host.

**Lesson for verification.** A cloud vision model read the proof screenshot and said the console was NOT there — it was **wrong** (that same model had already misread the screen once, reporting Claude's chat text as test output). For "is it really on screen?", trust **Windower** or **Angela**, never a vision model's screenshot read.

## 2026-08-05 — LaTeXer `structure` reported an EMPTY title/author for EVERY document (`latexer.py`)

**What was wrong.** `_document_structure()` — the `get_latex_structure` capability — returned `title: ""` and `author: ""` for **every real LaTeX document**. Its helper searched with a `$`-anchored pattern (`\\title\s*\{(.+?)\}\s*$`) but **without `re.MULTILINE`**, so `$` matched only the end of the WHOLE file. `\title{...}` lives in the *preamble* of literally every document ever written, so it never matched. Silent, because a blank string looks like a perfectly valid answer.

**The fix.** `re.MULTILINE` on that one `re.search`. **The `$` anchor itself must STAY** — it is what lets a braced title (`\title{A \textbf{Bold} One}`) capture in full, because only the LAST `}` on the line sits at end-of-line. The other two patterns routed through the same helper (`documentclass`, `class_options`) carry no `$`, so they are unaffected.

**How it was found.** By the new **`agent/test_latexer_suite.py`** on its very first run — a 300+ test asset Angela commissioned the same day (*"a vast powerful set of tests… no less than 100 different tests"*). Pinned by `StructureTests.test_title_REGRESSION_multiline_anchor` / `test_author_REGRESSION_multiline_anchor` / `test_a_braced_title_captures_in_full`.

**Also landed with it — `agent/test_latexer_suite.py` (316 tests, 31 classes).** A permanent, LaTeX-distribution-FREE unit sweep of every pure function (coercion, path safety, comment stripping, structure, validation, log parsing, templates, argv, project discovery, clean, preflight, section emission, contract constants). It is deliberately distinct from `test_latexer_agent.py`, which pins the wiring and the real MiKTeX end-to-end compiles. Run it standalone for a per-class breakdown: `python Tlamatini/agent/test_latexer_suite.py`.

**One test was wrong, not the code — kept as a lesson.** `test_the_missing_engine_refusal_names_MiKTeX` first paired `latex=""` with `distribution="miktex"`, a state that can never exist because the distribution is identified BY RUNNING the engine (`_identify_distribution("")` returns `"none"`). The suite went red, the product was right, the fixture was the lie. Now pinned by `MiktexHintTests`.

## 2026-08-04 — SPACE-bar bulk check/uncheck of a text-selected block of checkboxes (`checkbox_bulk_toggle.js`)

**What was wrong.** The Configure Mcps / Tools / Agents / Skills dialogs, the External-MCPs catalog and the ACP canvas agent-config dialogs list **dozens** of checkboxes. Clearing 20 of them cost 20 clicks — and there was no way to say "these ones, all at once". Every prior idea for fixing it (a select-all button, per-dialog range-select, shift-click) would have needed **per-dialog wiring**, so each new dialog would silently ship without it.

**The fix (Angela López Mendoza, 2026-08-04).** One self-contained IIFE — `agent/static/agent/js/checkbox_bulk_toggle.js` — with **ZERO per-dialog wiring**. The user drags an **ordinary text selection** across several checkbox labels and presses **SPACE once**: every checkbox the selection overlaps flips.

1. **Churn tables were treated as precious.** The *size* rule had already been made lenient with the explicit reasoning *"the user may have legitimately cleared their chat history"* — but the *row* rule still fired on the very tables that sentence describes (run ledger, chat history, sessions, caches).
2. **It never re-baselined.** The `CRITICAL/SUSPICIOUS` branch `return`ed **before** `write_sentinel()`, so the stale fingerprint was compared again on the next start, alarmed again, and copied the database aside again — **forever**, one copy per start. That is the whole 9.2 MB of junk.

**Why this mattered more than the noise.** A guard that cries wolf 11 times is a guard everyone learns to ignore — and the next alarm might be the **zero-byte database** this module exists to catch. Fixing the false positive is what keeps the real alarm credible.

**The fix (Angela López Mendoza, 2026-08-05).** Three surgical changes in `agent/db_guard.py`:

- **`VOLATILE_TABLES`** — a frozenset of tables exempt from the row-drop rule (`agent_chatagentrun`, `agent_agentmessage`, `agent_acpsession`, `agent_agentprocess`, `agent_contextcache`, `agent_sessionstate`, `agent_skillinvocation`, `django_session`, `django_admin_log`). A table **VANISHING** is still reported even when listed here — that is schema damage, not churn.
- **Re-baseline after a SUSPICIOUS start** so the same legitimate change is reported **once**, not on every start forever.
- **`MAX_EVIDENCE_COPIES = 10`** with `_prune_evidence()` — the evidence directory can no longer grow without bound.

**DO NOT weaken these — each prevents a specific, silent failure:**

1. **The listener MUST stay on `document` in the CAPTURE phase** (`document.addEventListener('keydown', onKeyDown, true)`). Bubble phase is a silent **data-corrupting** bug, not a style preference: `external_mcps_dialog.js` already binds Space on `.emx-row` and only calls `preventDefault()`, so it would toggle the focused row **first** and our pass would toggle it **again** — netting that one row back to its original state while all its neighbours flipped. `stopPropagation()` is called **only for a SPACE we actually consumed**, so Escape / Tab / Enter / Ctrl+Z and every other key reach their handlers exactly as before.
2. **It bails on `input` / `textarea` / `select` / `contenteditable`, testing BOTH `event.target` AND `document.activeElement`.** The `activeElement` half is not redundant: after a mouse-drag the target is usually `<body>`, so a target-only guard would steal SPACE from every search box in the app.
3. **It toggles with `checkbox.click()` — a REAL click.** Every existing click/change handler still runs (state persistence, the External-MCPs 5-active cap, the ACP canvas dialogs). Setting `.checked` directly would skip them and silently lose the user's change.
4. **The range-overlap test is STRICT** — a zero-length touch at a boundary does not count — so selecting label A never drags in the first character of label B.
5. **A row must own EXACTLY ONE checkbox** (`node.querySelectorAll('input[type="checkbox"]').length !== 1` breaks the walk up). Without it a whole list container could be mistaken for a single row, and *any* selection would toggle the entire dialog.
6. **Self-re-rendering lists are handled by re-resolving each checkbox right before it is clicked** (`makeResolver`, by `id` then `[data-key]` then `isConnected`). The External-MCPs catalog rebuilds every row from its model on each toggle, so a snapshotted element is already detached by the time the loop reaches it; a row that vanished is skipped, never clicked while detached.
7. **Nothing acts without a non-collapsed selection that overlaps a checkbox** — with no targets it returns **before** `preventDefault()`, so native SPACE (page scroll, focused-checkbox toggle) is untouched. Every step is wrapped in `try/catch`: a failure degrades to "SPACE did nothing", never to a broken page.

**The chat toolbar toggles (`#multi-turn-enabled`, `#acpx-enabled`, `#ask-execs-enabled`, …) are UNREACHABLE by design**, and that is not an accident to be "fixed": `.toolbar-toggle` carries `user-select: none` in `agent_page.css`, so no text selection can ever be made over them and no bulk pass can ever flip a run-shaping flag behind the user's back.

It is an IIFE that declares **NO cross-file globals** (same shape as `chat_image_paste.js`), so it cannot trip the const-poison contract and needs no `eslint.config.mjs` globals entry.

**Wired in**: `agent_page.html` **and** `agentic_control_panel.html` (a `?v={{ STATIC_VERSION }}_bulktoggle` cache-buster on both). A module nobody loads does nothing — both pages must keep the tag, and `staticfiles/` must be re-collected (`python Tlamatini/manage.py collectstatic --noinput`) or the browser downloads a stale copy.

## 2026-07-31 — Self-modify snapshot was shipping LIVE credentials (`copy_source_assets.py`)

**What was wrong.** `copy_source_assets.py` walks the **WORKING TREE**, not git. So a file that `.gitignore` keeps out of history is still physically on disk — and was being copied straight into `TlamatiniSourceCode/`, from there into `pkg.zip`, and out to **every user** of a `--self-modify` build. Git history stayed spotless while the **build** leaked. Found live by the self-modify inclusion sweep on 2026-07-31, carrying two real secrets:

- **`open_router.key`** (repo root) — a live OpenRouter `sk-or-v1-…` API key.
- **`.claude/skills/tlamatini-daily-chat-test/harness/.creds.env`** — the chat-test `TLAMATINI_USER` / `TLAMATINI_PASS` login.

Neither was ever committed. The exposure was **build-only**, and nothing had shipped yet (no `pkg.zip`/`dist` existed at the time).

**Why neither guard caught it.** The generator only redacted `config.json`, `external_mcps.json`, `contacts.json` and agent `config.yaml`, and excluded `data.keys` by exact name — there was **no rule for credential files by extension**. And the sweep's secret check only scanned **config-type suffixes** (`.json/.yaml/.env/.ini/.cfg/.toml`) for **machine-token value shapes** — so a `.key` file was never even opened, and a plain human password in `.env` matches no token regex. Both filters were content-shaped; neither asked the simpler question *"should this FILE exist here at all?"*.

**The fix.**

- **`copy_source_assets.py`** — new `SECRET_FILE_EXTENSIONS` (`.key .keys .pem .p12 .pfx .jks .keystore .env .asc .gpg .ppk`) + `SECRET_FILE_GLOBS` (`.env`, `.env.*`, `id_rsa*`, `id_ed25519*`), enforced by `_is_secret_file()` in `_skip_file`'s **first tier — the same NEVER-resurrected tier as `EXCLUDED_FILE_NAMES`, i.e. BEFORE `KEEP_PATH_GLOBS`**, so a KEEP carve-out can never resurrect a secret. A bare `.env` needs the *name* glob because `Path(".env").suffix` is `""` (a leading dot makes the whole name a STEM) — the extension test alone silently misses it.
- **New `DROP_PATH_GLOBS`** (+ `_is_dropped_by_path()`) — path-anchored always-drop for run artifacts. Currently one entry: the dated chat-test `harness/reports/**` (29 gitignored files, ~1.2 MB). **Path-anchored on purpose** — a bare `reports` in `EXCLUDED_DIR_NAMES` would be far too broad and could drop real source elsewhere.
- **`sweep_self_modify.py`** — `check_redaction` gained a **STRUCTURAL guard**: a credential-bearing **file present in the snapshot is a FINDING regardless of its bytes**. Value-shape scanning is necessary but provably not sufficient; presence alone is now the test.

## 2026-07-26 — Binary-content guard on the RAG context loader (`binary_guard.py`)

**What was wrong.** The ONLY filter on the context/embedding chain was the name-based **Context ▸ Set file type omissions** list plus a 4-entry default denylist (`package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`, …). Anything else — a `.png`, a `.pyc`, a vendored `.so`, a `.faiss` index, a 200 MB `.safetensors`, a `.mp4` — was opened by `CustomTextLoader` with `autodetect_encoding=True`, decoded into mojibake, chunked and **embedded**. That poisoned FAISS/BM25 with noise, burned embedding VRAM and wall-clock, and diluted real retrieval hits. A name-based list structurally cannot fix this: you cannot enumerate every binary extension a user's project will contain.

**The fix.** A new stdlib-only engine `agent/rag/binary_guard.py` classifies files by **content** and drops the binary ones through the *same* mechanism the user omissions already use, so nothing downstream changes shape.

- **Short-circuiting cascade, cheapest first, at most ONE `read()`**: extension denylist (zero I/O, 192 extensions) → one 8 KiB sample → empty → **BOM** → 45 magic signatures → NUL byte → control-byte ratio (`bytes.translate`, one C-speed pass) → UTF-8 decodability. Sampling a 4 GB video costs what a README costs. `test_only_the_sample_is_read_not_the_whole_file` and `test_at_most_one_read_per_file` pin this.
- **Hook**: `CustomTextLoader.__init__` records the verdict and `raise`s `ValueError`; `DirectoryLoader(silent_errors=True)` swallows it — byte-identical to how a name-based omission is dropped.
- **All THREE `DirectoryLoader` call sites** in `factory.py` are wired (context directory, single context file, `application/`). `test_all_three_directory_loaders_receive_the_settings` asserts exactly 3 — miss one and that path silently loads binaries again.
- **Logging**: `--- [BINARY-GUARD]` lines name every dropped file with the stage and reason that condemned it. `manage.py` tees stdout into `tlamatini.log` before Django boots, so this works in **frozen and source** mode identically. Drops are collected in a lock-protected `BinaryOmissionRecorder` because `DirectoryLoader` runs 12 threads, then printed as one block after `load()` — never interleaved.
- **Config**: `binary_context_detection` (default `true`) + `binary_detection_sample_bytes` / `_control_ratio` / `_log_each_file` / `_extra_binary_extensions` / `_force_text_extensions`.

**DO NOT weaken these — each prevents a specific, silent data-loss failure:**

1. **FAIL-OPEN, always.** Unreadable file, permission error, deleted-mid-scan, a directory path, `None`, garbage config → verdict is **TEXT**. `classify_file()` never raises. A guard that wrongly drops a file silently deletes the user's real context; that is strictly worse than embedding some noise.
2. **The BOM stage MUST stay ahead of the NUL stage.** UTF-16/UTF-32 text is legitimately full of `0x00`. Reorder them and every UTF-16 document on disk silently vanishes from the context. Pinned by `test_utf16_bom_beats_the_nul_test`. Likewise the BOM table is ordered longest-prefix-first (`\xff\xfe\x00\x00` before `\xff\xfe`), pinned by `test_bom_table_is_ordered_longest_prefix_first`.
3. **High bytes (0x80-0xFF) count as TEXT.** Counting them as binary evidence would strip every accented UTF-8 and legacy cp1252/latin-1 source file. Pinned by `test_accented_utf8_without_bom_is_text` and `test_latin1_legacy_text_is_kept`.
4. **`force_text_extensions` beats the built-in denylist**, so a user can always rescue a file the tables get wrong.
5. **Keep the two extension tables disjoint.** `test_tables_do_not_overlap` exists because the first draft listed `.ts` as BOTH TypeScript (text) and MPEG transport stream (binary) — which would have dropped every TypeScript file in a project. It now lives in TEXT only; a genuine MPEG-TS is still caught by the NUL stage. The same review moved `.hex` (Intel HEX is ASCII — and mission-critical for STM32er/Arduiner/ESP32er) and `.eps` (PostScript is text) out of the denylist.

**Relationship to the existing omissions list**: complementary, not a replacement. Name-based omissions = "what the user chooses to ignore"; the guard = "what is binary regardless of its name". Both still run, the user list first.

## 2026-07-26 — Full-suite repair: 26 of 28 failures fixed, and what they taught

The suite ran **3462 tests → 26 failures + 2 errors**. Almost none were product bugs; they cluster into four causes worth knowing.

### A. The secret scrubber silently broke its own tests

`regen_secrets.py` (and the public-release scrubber) rewrite `"password": "<REDACTED>"`-shaped literals. They had rewritten **the test fixtures** to `<REDACTED>` while leaving the assertions expecting the old values — 8 failures in `test_password_quoting.py` plus `test_secret_008_env_secret_real_value`. Two second-order bites:

- `<REDACTED>` has **no spaces**, and the entire point of `test_password_quoting` is proving a *space-bearing* password stays double-quoted in YAML. The scrub did not just break the test, it made it meaningless. Fixtures now use the obviously-fake, space-bearing `fake app pass 0000`.
- `<REDACTED>` contains `<` and `>`, which **are** markers in `_looks_like_placeholder`. The "a REAL value must NOT be flagged" case therefore asserted the exact opposite of its intent. (My first replacement failed too — it contained the word "placeholder". The value must be opaque gibberish.)

A real Gmail-shaped app password was also removed from the repo in the process.

### B. Order-dependent logging tests (a whole class)

`test_parametrizer_mcp_doctor` (3 tests) and `test_zavuerer_agent::test_emit_section_atomic` attach a handler to the ROOT logger to capture an agent's `logging.info(...)` — but never set the level. The root logger defaults to WARNING, so the record is dropped **before** reaching the handler. They passed only when an earlier test in the same process had lowered the level, and failed the moment the module ran alone. **If a test captures `logging.info`, it must set `root.setLevel(logging.INFO)` and restore it.**

### C. Tests pinning prose or an old shape instead of the contract

- `test_step_by_step_prompt_includes_mcp_doctor` pinned the sentence `"wait for the user's READY"`; the prompt was reworded to the same promise. Now asserts the contract.
- `test_wizard_is_catalog_slot_one` still expected `----<set name here>----` / `<USERNAME>`; the catalog moved to the `[[ user types ]]` / `{{ runtime }}` grammar.
- `test_material_value_list_survives` asserted `out['material']`, but the code deliberately remaps `material` → `material_path` (the plugin's wire key).
- `test_action_routes` demanded `/health` from Zavu — **an endpoint that never existed** (it 404s); the agent probes `/senders` on purpose.
- `test_agent_libs_*`: `build.py` now writes `_agent_libs = list(_AGENT_RUNTIME_IMPORTS)`, and the literal-only AST reader returned `[]` — so the "list is substantial / includes mcp, serial, fitz" guards were asserting about an EMPTY list. The reader now follows one alias hop.
- `test_explicit_migration_display_names_all_resolve` demanded descriptions for **retired** agents (Telegramer / Telegramrx / WhatsTlamatini). Migrations are immutable history, so their names live on in old `*_add_*.py` files; the check is now scoped to agents that still exist on disk.
- `test_every_registry_example_resolves_against_its_template`: whatsapper's `example_request` said `use to='+52…'` in prose, and the arg-parser read the words before `=` as a parameter named `use to`. **Prose inside an `example_request` must never contain `word=value`** unless `word` is a real config key.

### D. Two REAL findings the tests were right about

1. **A live `zv_live_…` Zavu API key was committed** in `agent/agents/zavuerer/config.yaml`. Fixed by `python regen_secrets.py --mode push-able` (all 8 secret files → placeholders; `data.keys` holds the real values). The test now accepts `''` **or** a `<NAME goes here>` placeholder and **fails loudly on a real key prefix** (`zv_live_`, `sk-`, `ghp_`) — because demanding exactly `''` failed in push-able mode, the one state where the file is provably clean.
2. **`docs/external_mcp_bulletproof_architecture.md` did not exist** although CLAUDE.md and 5 other files reference it. Written from the verified code.

### Left failing on purpose

The **5 `TalkerFemaleVoiceAudibleTests`** are true integration tests: they need Ollama + Orpheus + SNAC actually producing audio (`samples.size == 6` where ≥12000 is required). No code change fixes that — they pass only with the TTS stack live.

### Also: `contacts.json` is Angela's LIVE contacts book

`ShippedContactsFileTests` hardcoded a real person's Telegram handle. It now round-trips the resolver against whatever the file contains and checks an unknown name fails closed — **no real handle in the suite**, and it cannot break when she adds a contact.

### Skill bodies have an 8 KiB cap

`roblox_studio` (+1435 B) and `setup_new_acpx_key` (+419 B) exceeded it, so `skills_pkg/_meta/lint.py` exited 1. Both were trimmed for redundancy with every technical fact kept.

## 2026-07-26 — GHOST dist-info metadata: pip was reporting conflicts that did not exist

**Trigger.** `pip: pyhackrf 0.2.0 requires numpy<2.0.0, but you have numpy 2.2.6`. Auditing it properly turned up something much bigger.

### The ghost class (this is the reusable lesson)

`site-packages` held **duplicate `*.dist-info` directories for ~30 packages** — a stale one plus a real one, because an install overwrote a package's files but pip never removed the old metadata directory (common with `+cpu` local versions, `--user` vs system site, and interrupted installs). Consequences:

- **`torch`** had `2.10.0` AND `2.12.1+cpu` dist-infos; the real code (`torch/version.py`) is **2.10.0+cpu**. The GHOST 2.12.1 is what declared `setuptools<82` — so the "torch requires setuptools<82" conflict was **entirely phantom**. Real torch 2.10.0 declares plain `setuptools`, no upper bound, and imports fine without `pkg_resources` (which setuptools 82 removed).
- **`starlette`** had `0.41.3` AND `1.3.1`; the real code is **1.3.1**. `pip check` read the ghost and claimed fastapi 0.140.0 was unsatisfied. It is satisfied.
- **`packaging`** was worse — a **split brain**: metadata said 25.0 while the imported module was 26.2, because the first `pip install` wrote the dist-info to a different site than the code that wins on `sys.path`. Fixed with `pip install --user --force-reinstall`; **always verify a version by IMPORTING it, not by reading metadata.**

### What was actually fixed

| Item | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| `numpy` pin | `numpy<2.3.0` — **no floor** | `numpy>=2.0,<2.3.0` (opencv-python 4.13 needs `>=2`; without a floor a resolver could install 1.x and silently break Camcorder/VideoPlayer/Video-Analyzer/Recorder/Whisperer) |
| `fastapi` | `==0.115.6` (wants starlette<0.42) | `==0.140.0` (wants `starlette>=0.46`) — matches the REAL starlette 1.3.1 |
| `packaging` | unpinned → 26.2 installed | `packaging<26.0.0` pinned, 25.0 installed (langchain-core needs `<26`; all 16 active consumers accept 25) |
| `hf-xet` | 1.5.0 | 1.5.1 (huggingface-hub 1.20.1 needs `>=1.5.1` — only visible once the hub ghost was gone) |
| 9 drifted pins | pinned older than installed | pinned to the installed, working versions (certifi, httpx, mcp, pillow, pydantic, python-dotenv, pywin32, typing-extensions, uvicorn) |

**Result: `pip check` went from 4 conflicts + 9 drifts to ONE line** — `pyhackrf`, which is provably benign (see the numpy comment block in `requirements.txt`).

### ⚠️ Ghost cleanup is DANGEROUS — the lesson from getting it wrong

The sweep that renames a stale dist-info aside compares it to the version in the package's `__init__.py`. For packages that expose **no** `__version__` (or a placeholder like `"unknown"`), that comparison matches NOTHING and the naive loop renames **every** dist-info, leaving the package with **zero metadata** — it happened here to `certifi`, `svglib` and `eval-type-backport` and had to be repaired by restoring the highest version. **Any such sweep MUST assert that at least one dist-info survives per package before it moves anything.** Backups are kept in place as `<name>-<ver>.dist-info.GHOST-BACKUP-2026-07-26` — rename one back to restore it.

### Tooling

`audit_dependencies.py` (repo root, read-only) prints who constrains a package, which requirements are **active** on this interpreter, whole-environment breakage, and requirements.txt drift. It **evaluates PEP 508 markers** — without that it reports 3 numpy conflicts on Python 3.12 when only 1 is real (`opencv-python: numpy<2.0 ; python_version < "3.9"` and `pandas: numpy>=2.3.3 ; python_version >= "3.14"` are both inactive). Run it on any interpreter: `python audit_dependencies.py requirements.txt`.

## 2026-07-26 — The Agent table is WIPED and re-seeded on EVERY boot (the "Pdfer" bug) + 11 dead canvas connections

**Symptom Angela hit.** Her freshly-built `C:\Tlamatini` showed **"Pdfer"** on the ACP canvas — but the Catalog of Prompts showed only **"108 prompts"** with **no Documents & PDF section**. Two different bugs wearing one costume.

### Cause 1 — the frozen DB was stuck at migration 0187 (why the prompts were missing)

The live `_internal/db.sqlite3` had `django_migrations` topping out at **0187**: PDFer's **0188 / 0189 / 0190 never ran**, so there were 108 prompts (max id 108), no `documents` category, and no `Chat-Agent-PDFer` Tool row. `DB/Older/2026-07-26_152818/` proved the post-update DB swap HAD happened — the user's older DB was restored and the **post-update `migrate` did not follow**. The migration FILES shipped correctly (verified present in `_internal/agent/migrations/`); only the apply step was missing. **When diagnosing "my new build doesn't have X", read `django_migrations` first** — a shipped-but-unapplied migration looks exactly like a broken feature.

### Cause 2 — `AgentConfig.ready()` DELETES every Agent row on every startup

`agent/apps.py::ready()` runs `Agent.objects.all().delete()` and rebuilds the table from the `agents/` folder listing on **every single server start**. So **the boot code — not the migration — is the effective source of truth for every display name**; migration 0188's carefully cased `PDFer` was overwritten with `str.title()` → `Pdfer` on the next launch. (This also explains a fresh `migrate` writing mis-cased rows: the historical `NNNN_repopulate_all_agents` migrations use the same old `.title()` logic. Never edit those — history is immutable — the first boot corrects them.)

The old logic was `.title()` + five ad-hoc overrides, and it shipped **22 of 86 names wrong**: Pdfer, Sqler, Ssher, Pser, Scper, Acpxer, Esp32Er, Esphomer, Audioplayer, Videoplayer, Flowcreator, Flowhypervisor, Flowbacker, Teletlamatini, Mcp Doctor, …

### Cause 3 (found while fixing 2) — a spaced display name can NEVER match a hyphen-only canvas handler

`acp-canvas-core.js` compares `targetAgentName.toLowerCase()` **without collapsing whitespace**, and for eleven agents it only ever tests the **HYPHENATED** literal. A DB row saying `"Video Analyzer"` matches nothing, so **the connection was silently never persisted** — no error, no log line, just wiring that vanishes. Affected: Kyber-KeyGen, Kyber-Cipher, Kyber-DeCipher, J-Decompiler, Video-Analyzer, De-Compresser, File-Creator, File-Extractor, File-Interpreter, Image-Interpreter, Monitor-Log.

### The fix

- **`agent/apps.py::_canonical_agent_display_name(folder, fallback)`** — the boot repopulate now resolves names through **`services/agent_paths.py::display_name_from_agent_type`**, the same map the Flow Compiler and Agent Contracts already use. **FAIL-OPEN**: any import/lookup problem returns the caller's legacy value, so a naming refinement can never stop the app booting. The legacy `.title()` chain is left in place purely as that fallback.
- **`agent/services/agent_paths.py`** — added `audioplayer`/`videoplayer`/`flowcreator`/`flowhypervisor`/`flowbacker`/`mcp_doctor` (case) and `video_analyzer`/`de_compresser`/`file_creator`/`file_extractor`/`file_interpreter`/`image_interpreter`/`monitor_log` (hyphen). Also **pinned `apirer` to `Apirer`** (was `APIrer`) so the sidebar label Angela already knows does not churn — `agents.md` and `chat_agent_registry` both say `Apirer`.
- **`agent/chat_agent_registry.py`** — `File Creator`→`File-Creator`, `File Extractor`→`File-Extractor`, `File Interpreter`→`File-Interpreter`, `Image Interpreter`→`Image-Interpreter`, `Monitor Log`→`Monitor-Log`.
- **`agent/mcp_agent.py`** — `_TOOL_TO_AGENT_DISPLAY_NAME` (`Image-Interpreter` ×3) and the `_EXEC_REPORT_TOOLS` caption for `chat_agent_file_creator` (`agent_key` stays `filecreator`, so the CSS gradient rule still matches).

### Two MORE surfaces keyed on the display name (found by the post-rename sweep)

Renaming an agent is not done when `agent_paths` + the registry agree. A repo-wide sweep caught two more places that carry the display name **verbatim**:

- **`agentic_control_panel.css`** — `.agent-tool-item[data-content="<Display>"] .agent-tool-icon`. CSS attribute values are **case-sensitive**, so `[data-content="Sqler"]` stopped matching the moment the agent became `SQLer`. Fixed 6: `Flowcreator`→`FlowCreator`, `Monitor Log`→`Monitor-Log`, `Pser`→`PSer`, `Scper`→`SCPer`, `Sqler`→`SQLer`, `Ssher`→`SSHer`, and deleted the dead `Recmailer` twin (the file already carried BOTH `Recmailer` and `RecMailer` — someone had hit this before and papered over it).
  **Impact was cosmetic-only, and smaller than it looks:** the sidebar icon's real colour comes from `getAgentToolIconStyle()`, which probes a `.canvas-item.<x>-agent` class built by `getAgentTypeClass()` (lowercase+hyphen, casing-proof) and then writes an **inline** style — which beats these stylesheet rules anyway. 36 live agents have no `data-content` rule at all and colour correctly. They were still fixed so the file stops naming agents that do not exist.
- **`agent_page_chat.js::_agentPurpose`** — a `{'<Display>': 'purpose'}` map read when building a `.flw` node. 11 stale keys (`File Creator`, `File Interpreter`, `File Extractor`, `Image Interpreter`, `Monitor Log`, `Ssher`, `Scper`, `Pser`, `Sqler`, `Recmailer`, `Flowbacker`) would have produced nodes with an empty `agentPurpose`.

Both are now pinned: `test_css_data_content_selectors_match_live_display_names` and `test_agent_purpose_map_keys_match_live_display_names` fail if any key/selector names an agent that no longer exists. **After editing either file, run `collectstatic`** — the collected copies under `staticfiles/` are what get served, and they were stale until it ran (2 files copied).

### ⚠️ DO NOT change ONE side of a display name

The DB row and `chat_agent_registry.display_name` drive **two different things** — the canvas connection handler (DB row) and the per-agent enable gate **`agent_<display>_status`** (registry). Hyphenating only `agent_paths` would leave the gate looking up a key that no longer exists; it **fails open**, so unchecking that agent in *Configure Agents* would silently stop hiding it from the LLM. That is exactly why the five file/monitor agents were done as a **single coordinated pass across both files**, and why `video_analyzer` / `de_compresser` were safe from the start (their registry names were already hyphenated).

### Coverage

`agent/test_agent_display_names.py` (7 tests) — locks the exact name for 31 agents, forbids `.title()` digit-mangling (`Stm32Er`), **parses the JS connection literals and fails if any display name cannot match its handler**, pins the `apps.py` source contract, proves fail-open, and asserts registry ↔ canvas agreement. Plus `tests_e2e/test_prompts_catalog_visual.py` — a HEADED-Chrome walk of the whole catalog (11/11 checks, 21 full-desktop screenshots, all 14 sections, `Documents & PDF` = 5 prompts, click-to-insert proven).

**Live-verified in dev after the fix:** 86 agent rows, `PDFer` (single row, correct casing), **0 mis-cased**, 113 prompts, catalog counter reads `113 prompts`.

## 2026-07-26 — Ask Execs: MESSAGING IS UNGATED (tier B reversed) — do NOT re-add it

**Angela's decision, verbatim:** *"Messages must be able to be sent without asking, it depends only on AI desisicion."*

Tier B was added to the Ask-Execs allowlist on **2026-07-14** on the "you cannot unsend it" argument. On **2026-07-26 she reversed it**. Sending a message is now **the LLM's own judgement call** — no Proceed/Deny prompt stands between Tlamatini and a real human. Removed from `mcp_agent.py::_ASK_EXECS_REQUIRED_TOOLS`:

`chat_agent_send_email` · `chat_agent_whatsapper` · `chat_agent_telegrammer` · `chat_agent_zavuerer` (and `chat_agent_instant_messaging_doctor` was never added, including when `retry_send=true` makes it re-send).

**The gate is now RUNNERS + tier A + tier D only.** Tiers B and C are both deliberately ungated — B because messaging is the AI's call, C because desktop/hardware operations are visible while they happen.

**What still protects a send** (state it honestly — it is not nothing, and it is not a prompt): the LLM's own judgement, the **Exec Report row** every send still produces, and the user's **Cancel**. ⚠️ **Zavuerer costs money per message** (pay-as-you-go) — that cost is accepted, not overlooked.

**DO NOT re-gate messaging "for safety."** `agent/test_ask_execs_allowlist.py::test_messaging_agents_are_NOT_gated` is an **inverse guard**: `MESSAGING_UNGATED` is an ANTI-list and the test asserts those names are ABSENT from the allowlist, so a well-meaning re-add fails loudly instead of silently restoring a prompt she removed on purpose.

**Two stale assertions fixed at the same time.** `agent/tests.py::AskExecsHelperTests.test_requires_exec_permission_gate` still encoded the **pre-2026-07-14** "tier 1/2 only" policy and had been failing ever since — it asserted that De-Compresser, unzip_file, File-Creator, Deleter, SCPer, Apirer and Crawler were all UNGATED, directly contradicting the authoritative pin in `test_ask_execs_allowlist.py`. It is now realigned to the real policy (A + D gated; B + C + ACPX/Skills not). Lesson: when a policy changes, grep for EVERY test that encodes it — the authoritative pin passing does not mean an older duplicate is not lying.

## 2026-07-26 — PDFer (the document composer) + a new "Documents & PDF" catalog section

**What landed.** Agent #86, **PDFer** — the WRITE side of the document family (File-Extractor / File-Interpreter READ documents; PDFer AUTHORS them). `agent/agents/pdfer/` renders Tlamatini's own answer, Markdown, HTML, plain text, images and/or existing PDFs into ONE styled PDF. Wrapped as `chat_agent_pdfer`; migrations `0188` (Agent row) / `0189` (Tool row) / `0190` (the new catalog section).

**Three contracts that must NOT be reverted:**

1. **ZERO new dependencies — and the pipeline is ported INLINE, not imported.** `markdown` + `xhtml2pdf` + `pymupdf` + `reportlab` + `pillow` + `pypdf` were already pinned in `requirements.txt` and already used by `agent/doc_generation`. `pdfer.py` carries its own copy of `markdown_text_to_pdf` + `DEFAULT_CSS` from `agent/doc_generation/mardown_to_pdf.py` because **a pool subprocess can never `import agent.*`** (the acpxer.py precedent). Every backend is imported LAZILY inside the function that needs it, so a machine missing one reports `status: engine_unavailable` instead of crashing at import. **`build.py::_AGENT_RUNTIME_IMPORTS` gained `markdown` / `xhtml2pdf` / `reportlab` / `PIL`** so a carried Python that loses one FAILS THE BUILD LOUDLY (the numpy/cv2 lesson) rather than shipping a pool agent that dies at runtime.

2. **PDFer is on the Ask-Execs tier-A allowlist — and that is deliberate.** It only ever *writes* a new file, which superficially looks like the media agents (Shoter/Camcorder/Recorder) that are NOT gated. The difference is decisive: the media agents write a collision-proof name into ONE fixed known-folder, whereas PDFer takes a free-form `output_dir` + `filename` and can therefore clobber a file the user cares about, exactly like File-Creator. **Do not "simplify" it out of `_ASK_EXECS_REQUIRED_TOOLS`** — `agent/test_ask_execs_allowlist.py` pins it in both directions. Same reasoning put it in `tools.py::_PRE_LAUNCH_PREVIEW_BY_TEMPLATE` (so the user sees WHERE it is about to write) rather than the observational set.

3. **`agent_paths.display_name_from_agent_type` needs the `"pdfer": "PDFer"` override.** Without it `.title()` renders **"Pdfer"**, which violates the naming convention (the display name is exactly the DB `agentDescription`). This was a REAL bug caught by the new test suite, not a hypothetical — the same class as STM32er/ACPXer/SSHer. Any new agent whose display name is not plain Title-Case needs the same override.

**Also fixed while building it:** the `fit` image layout originally opened each raster with `fitz.open()` and read `[0].rect`, which silently produced A4-shaped pages for every picture; it now sizes the page from the image's real pixel dimensions via `_image_size` (Pillow, with an A4 fallback). And `_as_int` now rejects non-scalars — an arbitrary object fell through to `str(raw)`, whose repr hex address yielded a digit run, so junk became `0` (e.g. a 0 mm margin) instead of the default.

**New catalog section.** `views.PROMPT_CATEGORY_ORDER` gained `('documents', 'Documents & PDF')` between `code_gen` and `images` — the first new section since categories were introduced. Migration `0190` appends ids **109-113** (never renumbering) with `sort_rank` 10/20/30/40/50; **rank 10 is the reserved Step-by-Step opener slot** Angela requires in every section. `agent/test_prompt_catalog_contiguous.py::expected_first` gained `'documents': 109` — a new section without an opener now FAILS that test rather than slipping through.

**Pre-launch preview backlog cleared at the same time (Angela asked for it explicitly).** `test_every_wrapped_chat_agent_is_in_preview_or_observational_set` had been failing on **9 older agents** that were never categorized after they shipped. Each was audited IN THE DEV TREE line-by-line — not inferred from its `config.yaml` keys — by asking one question: *does it mutate anything beyond its own log + PID file (the shared boilerplate)?*

| Agent | Evidence | Set |
|---|---|---|
| `editor` | `editor.py:378` opens `file_path` with mode `'w'` — rewrites the target | **preview** |
| `nmapper` | `-oX`/`-oN` scan artifacts + fires packets at `target` | **preview** |
| `discoverer` | writes `json_path` results + runs an active recon tool at `target` | **preview** |
| `zavuerer` | POSTs `/v1/messages` — a real message, cannot be unsent, costs money | **preview** |
| `instant_messaging_doctor` | non-mutating by default, but `retry_send=true` really POSTs WhatsApp `/messages` + Telegram `sendMessage` | **preview** |
| `globber`, `grepper` | enumerate paths / read contents; only log + PID written | observational |
| `mcp_doctor` | STATIC catalog triage — its only `Popen` is the boilerplate `start_agent`; it never connects (unlike the live `external_mcp_doctor` tool) | observational |
| `video_analyzer` | reads a recorded video + asks Ollama for a verdict | observational |

The five preview entries list only keys that **actually exist** in each template `config.yaml` — verified by rendering every preview against its real template and asserting no line contains the `<MISSING>` sentinel. Coverage is now **64 wrapped agents, 0 uncategorized, 0 in both sets**, and the full suite went 28 → 27 failures (the remaining 27 + 2 errors are unrelated pre-existing ones, proven by a `git stash` baseline).

**Note for Angela (policy, not code):** `instant_messaging_doctor` can reach a real human when `retry_send=true`, yet it is **NOT** on the Ask-Execs tier-B allowlist. That is arguably a gap of the same class as the 2026-07-14 Deleter/Whatsapper one — but adding it is a policy decision, so it was left alone.

**Coverage:** `agent/test_pdfer_agent.py` (74 tests). They drive the **REAL** renderers, not fakes — faking them would hide the one failure that actually matters (a backend missing from the carried Python), so every render test writes a genuine PDF to a temp dir and re-reads it with pypdf. Only the network is stubbed (`_ollama_polish` against an unreachable port, to prove the "never lose the document" fallback).

## 2026-07-22 — FlowCreator is now chat-callable as `chat_agent_flowcreator` (prompt in → real `.flw` file out), and it no longer reports failures as successes

**What changed.** FlowCreator used to be **canvas-only** — the node's Save button POSTed to `execute_flowcreator/` and the browser JS rendered `flow_result.json` onto the canvas. There was no way to say *"create me a flow that does X"* in chat and get a file back. It is now also a **wrapped chat-agent**: `chat_agent_flowcreator(prompt='<objective>', flow_filename='<name>.flw'[, output_dir=…])` writes a real, canvas-loadable **`.flw` file** to disk (default `<app>/Temp`).

**Four code changes (all in `agent/agents/flowcreator/` + the registry):**
1. `flowcreator.py` now **writes the `.flw` itself** — it already produced `flow_result.json`; a new `_write_flw_file()` runs it through the converter and writes the file, and emits ONE authoritative `INI_SECTION_FLOWCREATOR` whose header carries `status` / `flw_path` / `flow_filename` / `agent_count` / `connection_count` (the raw LLM response is logged as a plain `--- RAW LLM RESPONSE ---` block, NOT a second section, so Parametrizer/the LLM never see two competing sections).
2. **Vendored `agent/agents/flowcreator/result_to_flw.py`** (a copy of the `flow_making` skill's converter) — a pool subprocess can never `import agent.*`, so the `flow_result.json → .flw` converter must ship **inside** the template dir. Keep it in sync with `agent/skills_pkg/flow_making/scripts/result_to_flw.py`.
3. **Exit code now reflects reality.** `flowcreator.py` used to `sys.exit(0)` on **every** path — no prompt, Ollama unreachable, unparseable response, any crash. The wrapped runtime maps exit 0 → `"completed"`, so a run that created **nothing** would have been reported to the user as a **SUCCESS** (green Exec-Report row, Create-Flow armed). A module-level `_FAILED` flag is now latched by `_write_error_result()` / a failed `_write_flw_file()`, and `main()` ends with `sys.exit(1 if _FAILED else 0)`. **The canvas path is UNAFFECTED** — `check_flowcreator_result_view` keys off the PID file + `flow_result.json`, never the exit code. **Do NOT revert the exit-code change**: it is the one thing that stops the tool lying about a flow it never built.
4. `agent_contracts._PARAMETRIZER_OUTPUT_FIELDS['flowcreator']` expanded from `("model", "response_body")` to also expose `status`, `flw_path`, `flow_filename`, `agent_count`, `connection_count`, so a downstream Parametrizer can address the new header fields.

**Wiring:** `ChatWrappedAgentSpec(key="flowcreator", …)` in `chat_agent_registry.py`; migration `0186` seeds the `Chat-Agent-FlowCreator` Tool row (the Agent row already existed from `0031`) + the mandatory Catalog-of-Prompts demo (appended at the next free `idPrompt`, `sort_rank=85` in *Agents & Flows*). Exec-Report capture is automatic via the generic `_resolve_exec_report_spec` fallback — no `_EXEC_REPORT_TOOLS` entry needed. `config.yaml` gained an `output_dir` key.

**Verified LIVE** with Angela's own example (`glassfish_error_alert.flw`, 7 agents / 6 connections): `Starter → Monitor-Log → Raiser → Summarizer → Parametrizer → Telegrammer → Ender`. Ruff clean; `0186` applied; `test_ask_execs_allowlist` (FlowCreator is not in the gated allowlist — it neither destroys data, contacts a human, nor reaches a remote system; it only writes a local file) still 8/8.

## 2026-07-21 — Catalog of Prompts standardized onto ONE parameter grammar (`[[ ]]` / `{{ }}` / `< >`) + `sort_rank` ordering (v1.44.0)

**What changed.** Every prompt in the `#prompts-catalog` modal now uses a single parameter grammar so the user and the runtime can never confuse whose blank is whose:
- **`[[ ... ]]`** — a value the **USER** fills in. Always collected in a fill-in block at the **TOP** of the prompt, with an unfilled-guard sentence beneath ("for any OPTIONAL field I leave as a marker or blank, use the stated default") so a one-click demo still runs on defaults.
- **`{{ ... }}`** — a value **Tlamatini fills at RUNTIME**.
- **`< ... >`** — a **REPORT slot only** (where the answer prints), never an input.

**Migrations (touch ONLY `promptContent`).** `0181` adds the `sort_rank` column and changes in-section ordering to `(category rank, sort_rank, idPrompt)`; `0182` seeds a **Step-by-Step section opener** at the reserved rank-10 slot of every category; `0183`/`0184`/`0185` rewrite the existing prompts across all 13 categories onto the grammar in batches. `idPrompt` / `promptName` / `category` / `sort_rank` / `hidden` are NEVER touched, so catalog ordering + contiguity hold byte-for-byte. `0183` also fixed a `C:/Temp` hardcode (Temp-policy break) in the Nmapper prompt #75.

**Do NOT** renumber existing `idPrompt`s, or hardcode a scratch path in a prompt. Append at `max(id)+1` and set `sort_rank` to place the card; obey the Temp/Templates policy. Pinned by `agent/test_prompt_catalog_contiguous.py`. Full contract: `CLAUDE.md` → the "Catalog-of-Prompts Example" section + `create_new_agent.md` Step 7.8.

## 2026-07-19 — Recon agents run FREE up to `OOB_shift_reaper`; NAMU voids it on shutdown

**Symptom.** A long real scan (a full-port nmap, a subfinder/nuclei run, a remote Kali job) was reaped mid-flight by the idle-child watchdog — the child was *working*, not hung, but the silence read as "stuck", so the scan died before it finished.

**Fix — a deliberate free-run window.** The three recon agents — **Kalier** (remote Kali), **Nmapper** (local nmap), **Discoverer** (ProjectDiscovery) — may now run uninterrupted up to **`OOB_shift_reaper` seconds (default 3600)** before the watchdog is even allowed to treat them as idle. `agent/agents/{kalier,nmapper,discoverer}/*.py` read the knob; `agent/apps.py` honours the window in the reaper path.

**Guard — NAMU, "God of Gods".** When Tlamatini herself is shutting down, the free-run window is **VOID**: NAMU runs FIRST (before the generic sweeps) and tree-kills every recon child immediately, regardless of how much of its window remained, so nothing survives her exit. **Do NOT** weaken the free-run for these three agents (long scans are normal work), and **do NOT** teach NAMU to respect the window (a shutdown must kill everything NOW). Developer-tuned; authorized targets only.

## 2026-07-19 — EMPTY code block SHREDDED the whole answer (`str.replace('', x)`) + saved the same file 101 times

**Symptom (Angela, dev instance):** a Kali-wizard reply came back as one `---Load in canvas: 20260719180442_install_prereqs.sh---` link **per character** — the sentence "Ping succeeded…" rendered as `P---Load in canvas: …---i---Load in canvas: …---n---…` — and the chat was flooded with **101 identical** `File: … saved!` notifications for ONE file.

**Root cause** — `agent/services/response_parser.py`, the named-code-block loop:

```python
llm_response = llm_response.replace(programContent, "<a …>---Load in canvas: NAME---</a><br>")
```

When the model emitted an **empty** block (`BEGIN-CODE<<<install_prereqs.sh>>>END-CODE`), `REGEX_NAMED_CODE_BLOCK` group 3 is `''`, so this became `llm_response.replace('', link)` — and **Python's `str.replace` with an empty needle inserts the replacement between EVERY character** (and at both ends). The same block being matched repeatedly also called `save_program()` once per match, producing the 101 writes + 101 WebSocket notifications.

**Fix (do NOT remove either guard):**
1. **Skip empty / whitespace-only blocks** at the top of the loop (`if not (programContent or '').strip(): continue`) — there is nothing to save and nothing to link, and this is what keeps an empty needle from ever reaching `.replace()`. It logs `--- Skipped an EMPTY code block named '<name>'`.
2. **De-duplicate identical blocks** (`_seen_code_blocks` keyed on `(programName, programContent)`) so a block repeated N times is written **once**, not N times.
3. The `.replace(programContent, …)` call is additionally wrapped in `if programContent:` as a belt-and-braces second line of defence.
4. The same two guards were applied to the **unnamed**-block loop (`_seen_unnamed_blocks`).

**Coverage:** `agent/tests.py::EmptyCodeBlockShredderTests` — `test_empty_code_block_never_shreds_the_answer` (prose stays contiguous, no anchor injected, and the `\w---Load in canvas:` shredder signature must never appear) and `test_same_code_block_repeated_is_saved_only_once` (patches `save_program`, asserts `await_count == 1`). `DiagramRenderingTests` (12) still green.

**Rule of thumb this encodes:** never call `str.replace(needle, …)` on model output without proving `needle` is non-empty — an empty needle does not "do nothing", it detonates the whole string.

## 2026-07-15 — Catalog of Prompts: two STM32 step-by-step blink demos + a one-time RE-GROUP/RE-SORT/NO-GAPS renumber (do NOT revert)

**What Angela asked:** two new Blue Pill / STM32F407G-DISC1 "classic LED blink" catalog prompts (Multi-Turn + Exec-report + Step-by-Step, from driver install through per-step verification to confirming the blink with the default camera), AND *"RE-GROUP THE PROMPTS, RE-SORT, WITH NO-GAPS THE Catalog of Prompts in the DB."*

**Migrations added:**
- **0178** — two firmware_iot prompts: a Blue Pill (STM32F103, external ST-LINK V2) and an STM32F407G-DISC1 (embedded ST-Link) step-by-step blink, each driving `chat_agent_stm32er` (PlatformIO backend) + `chat_agent_camcorder`. Badge inference (`tools_dialog.js::classifyPromptModes`): driving a `chat_agent_*` → Multi-turn (+ Exec-report auto); the UNFORMATTED phrase **"Step-by-Step mode"** (hyphenated + keyword) → the Step-by-Step badge. (There is also 0177, a simpler one-call Blue-Pill blink.)
- **0179** — **RE-NUMBERED the whole catalog to a contiguous 1..N**, ordered by (`views.PROMPT_CATEGORY_ORDER` rank, current idPrompt), rewriting `promptName='prompt-<n>'`. This **deliberately overrides the standing "NEVER renumber idPrompt" contract** — Angela authorised it directly, and it is safe because NOTHING binds a prompt by a fixed number at runtime (`list_prompts_view` groups by `category`; the `tools_dialog.js` fallback is gap-tolerant; `idPrompt` is not an FK). `idPrompt` is the PRIMARY KEY, so the renumber is **two-phase** (park every row at a +1,000,000 offset in target order, then bring them down to 1..N) to avoid PK collisions. Reverse is a documented no-op (originals not stored).

**Forward rule UNCHANGED:** the 0179 renumber was a ONE-TIME reorganization. New prompts still **append at max(idPrompt)+1** (which keeps the catalog contiguous). Do NOT write another renumber for a routine addition.

**Test updates required (do NOT revert):** the renumber invalidated id-specific assertions. `test_frontend_mutable_state.py::test_seeded_catalog_is_deduped_and_fully_tagged` was rewritten to assert **contiguity + no-dup-content + fully-tagged** instead of "ids 40-52 gone / 106 kept". `test_kalier_agent.py::test_prompt_catalog_is_contiguous` and the `test_blenderer_agent` promptName↔id lock-step now PASS (contiguity restored). New `agent/test_prompt_catalog_contiguous.py` pins the invariants (contiguous 1..N, promptName matches id, category-grouped blocks, the new firmware prompts present). All green; `createsuperuser` wizard stays at idPrompt 1 (getting_started, lowest id → renumbers to 1).

**Docs:** the CONTIGUITY contract in `CLAUDE.md` (and mirrored guidance) updated to "contiguous again after the one-time renumber; append-only going forward".

**NOT live:** source migrations only — a rebuild + post-update migrate is needed for the frozen `:8000` app.

**Do NOT:** re-introduce the old id-specific catalog assertions; write a renumber for a routine new prompt (append at max+1 instead); or drop the two-phase offset from 0179 (a naive in-place PK renumber collides).

## 2026-07-15 — STM32er widened to the WHOLE ST 32-bit line (Blue Pill → mainstream families): Phase 0 family gate + Phase 1 PlatformIO backend (do NOT revert)

**What:** STM32er was welded to ONE device (STM32F407VG) — its `_device_family` only recognised `STM32F0..F7` and its preflight REFUSED cross-family, so it wouldn't even flash a Blue Pill. It is now **dual-backend**, spanning F0..F7 / G0 / G4 / L0..L5 / H7 / U5 / WB. This is Phase 0 + 1 of the plan in `docs/stm32er_all_families_proposal.md` (Phase 2/3 = the ST-native STM32CubeCLT backend for STM32C0/H5/U0/WBA/**N6** — the N6 also needs external-flash boot + a signed FSBL — is NOT yet implemented).

**How (all in `agent/agents/stm32er/stm32er.py`, self-contained, stdlib-only):**
- **Phase 0 — de-welded the gate:** `_STM32_FAMILY_PREFIXES` (full family map, WBA before WB), `_device_family` broadened to every ST family. The cross-family REFUSE was NOT weakened — instead `_resolve_stm32_backend(config, action)` **ROUTES** by target: under `stm32_backend='auto'`, a `board`, a non-STM32F4 `device`, or a PlatformIO-only action goes to the pio backend; blank/F407 stays on the **template MCP unchanged (zero regression)**. Explicit `stm32_backend='platformio'|'template_mcp'` overrides.
- **Phase 1 — PlatformIO backend (`_pio_*` helpers + `_run_platformio_backend`):** clones ESP32er's proven `pio` machinery — drives PlatformIO Core's `ststm32` platform directly (no MCP server), zero-config bootstrap into the **SHARED** core dir `%LOCALAPPDATA%/Tlamatini/platformio` (the SAME one ESP32er uses — one PlatformIO install serves both), board catalog (`bluepill_f103c8`, …), `framework` default `arduino`, actions incl. `list_boards` / `scaffold_build_flash` and STM32-native `flash`/`build_and_flash` aliases.
- **Shared tail `_emit_and_trigger`:** BOTH backends emit ONE `INI_SECTION_STM32ER` and trigger downstream. KV header GAINED `backend` / `board` / `port` — registered in `agent_contracts._PARAMETRIZER_OUTPUT_FIELDS['stm32er']` (keep aligned).

**Fail-safe contract (do NOT weaken):** STM32 boards flash over ST-LINK/SWD, NOT a USB-serial bootloader — so `_pio_probe_stlink` probes the ST-LINK (`STM32_Programmer_CLI --list` via the existing `_probe_stlink`, then a `pio device list` VID-`0483` VCP fallback) and hard-refuses an upload ONLY on a **confident** absence; an inconclusive miss (a bare ST-LINK v2 dongle has no VCP to enumerate) only WARNS, so a legit Blue-Pill+dongle rig is never false-refused. The pio backend refuses `STM32C0/H5/U0/WBA/N6` cleanly (→ future CubeCLT).

**Wiring touched:** `config.yaml` (new `stm32_backend`/`board`/`framework`/`environment`/`pio_executable`/`pio_core_dir`/`pio_install_method`/`command_timeout`/`boards_query`/`pkg_spec`/`programmer_cli`); `services/agent_contracts.py` (KV fields); `tools.py` (`_seed_global_agent_defaults` SHARES `pio_executable`/`pio_core_dir` with ESP32er; param-hints map); `chat_agent_registry.py` (STM32er spec purpose/example/aliases teach the `board`+backend surface); docs (`agents.md`, `agents_descriptions.md` — the live tooltip, `agentic_skill.md` #67, `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`, `architecture.md`); demo prompt migration (Blue-Pill blink).

**Verified LIVE (source agent, via `mcp__tlamatini__stm32er`):** (1) `validate` + `stm32_backend='platformio'` + `board='bluepill_f103c8'` → `backend: platformio`, `pio_resolvable`, family STM32F1, `READY`, ST-LINK `confident_absent=True` (correct — no board attached). (2) `validate` + `device='STM32H743ZI'` (auto) → routed to platformio, board auto-mapped `nucleo_h743zi`, family STM32H7, `READY`. (3) `get_config` (blank/auto) → `backend: template_mcp`, MCP handshake OK, full F407 config — zero regression. `ruff` + `py_compile` clean.

**Do NOT:** re-narrow `_device_family` to STM32F-only; drop `backend`/`board`/`port` from the KV or the agent_contracts registration; hard-refuse a pio upload on an inconclusive ST-LINK miss; give the pio backend its own core dir (it MUST stay shared with ESP32er); or route blank/F407 to anything but the template MCP.

## Recent Fixes / Gotchas (keep these in mind)

### 2026-07-14 — Cancel did not cancel: the never-ending post-cancel run (`agent/cancellation.py`, the PER-RUN EPOCH LATCH)

**The symptom (Angela).** Cancel a Multi-Turn run → a few seconds later Tlamatini starts working again **by herself**, the Send button flips back to **"Cancel"**, and it repeats **forever**. Cancelling again just feeds the loop.

**The root cause — cancellation was a boolean with a ~20 ms lifetime.**

1. `consumers.py::cancel-current` **Step 1** raised `cancel_generation`, and **Step 8** *cleared it again* a few milliseconds later — it HAD to, because `setup_rag_chain()` bails out on that boolean (`consumers.py` 316/327/334 and 441/484/491, the last one nulls `self.rag_chain`) and **Step 9** rebuilds the chain. `rag/interface.py::ask_rag` cleared it a **second** time at the top of every request, so the user merely typing again un-cancelled a still-running zombie.
2. The **only** cancellation observer in Multi-Turn was `self_healing._cancelled()`, polling that same boolean every 0.25 s. After Step 8 it read `False` for the rest of the cancelled run → `ModelStepUnrecoverable("user_cancelled")` became **unreachable** → the 4096-tactic ladder ran on.
3. `mcp_agent.py` had **ZERO** cancellation reads (`grep cancel_generation mcp_agent.py` → nothing), so tools kept firing between/inside turns regardless.
4. The engine of the visible "🔁 Tactic #N" storm is the **classification-free `status == "timeout"` branch** in `self_healing.invoke` — it announced a tactic and `continue`d **without ever consulting `is_transient_error()` or cancellation**. (An earlier hypothesis — "abort_connection kills the executor's client → connection error → classified transient → retried" — is **WRONG**: `abort_connection()` closes the **OllamaLLM's** httpx client (`factory.py` 348-351 → `unified.py::abort_connection`), but the executor runs on a **separate `ChatOllama`** built by `_ensure_chat_tool_model` (`mcp_agent.py`:577) with its own client. **Do NOT "fix" this by touching `_TRANSIENT_MARKERS`.**)
5. Every tactic line went through the status broadcaster that `cancel-current` **never unregistered**, and the browser's `isSelfHealingStatusMessage()` branch called `disableControlsDuringOperation()` → button back to **"Cancel"**. That is literally "it starts again by itself".
6. Two more resurrection paths: `unified.py::_invoke_unified_agent_with_retry` **re-ran the ENTIRE executor** (re-executing tools, fresh healer, fresh 4096-tactic budget) up to 3× on its own transient list — which does **not** overlap `self_healing`'s, so errors the healer deliberately re-raises landed there — and the post-failure fallback fired **one more uncancellable LLM call** printing the (now lying) *"tool-calling backend is currently unavailable (transient network error)"* notice.

**The fix — `agent/cancellation.py`: a PER-USER RUN-EPOCH LATCH.** `begin_llm_run(uid)` mints a monotonically increasing epoch per user; `request_cancel_generation(uid)` raises the legacy boolean **and permanently latches that user's current epoch**; `is_run_cancelled(uid, epoch)` = `latched >= epoch`. A cancelled run stays cancelled **forever**; the user's NEXT run gets a higher epoch and runs normally. `clear_cancel_generation()` clears **only the boolean** — so Step 8 keeps working and the rebuild is never blocked.

**Contract — do NOT weaken any of these:**

- **PER USER, never one process-global high-water mark.** `global_state` is one process-wide singleton and Tlamatini admits concurrent runs (TeleTlamatini + a browser; two tabs) — the codebase already keys `last_request_meta::<uid>` per user for exactly this reason. A global latch would let a browser Cancel permanently kill a Telegram user's healthy run.
- **A MISSING epoch means NOT cancelled (fail-open).** `is_run_cancelled(uid, None)` is always `False`. If it meant "cancelled", a single dropped whitelist key would make **every** request after the first-ever cancel self-cancel on arrival.
- **THREE plumbing hops, all mandatory:** `ask_rag` payload → `UnifiedAgentChain.invoke`'s **payload-rebuild whitelist** (`unified.py`) → **both** executor sub-payloads (`UnifiedAgentChain` + `UnifiedAgentRAGChain`) → `CapabilityAwareToolAgentExecutor.invoke`'s `executor_payload` (`mcp_agent.py`). Miss any one and `run_epoch` is `None`, every guard silently no-ops, and the loop is back (the `exec_report_enabled` drop-on-rebuild bug class). Pinned by `agent/test_cancellation.py::CancelEpochPlumbingContractTests`.
- **Step 8's `clear_cancel_generation()` STAYS** — it must keep clearing only the boolean, or the chain rebuild aborts and leaves `self.rag_chain = None`.
- **The executor RETURNS on cancel, never `raise`s** (`_cancelled_result` → `_build_result_dict`), so the Exec report + Create-Flow log for the agents that DID run survive — and a raise would reach `unified.py`'s fallback and fabricate the lying "transient network error" answer.
- **`cancel-current` revokes the status emitter immediately** (identity-guarded with the SPECIFIC `_emit_status` handle stored on the consumer — `emit=None` would mute a second tab of the same user).
- **Frontend `userCancelledRun`** (`agent_page_state.js`, **`let` — never `const`**): while true, a late "Tactic #…" frame is a strict **no-op** (do NOT re-disable, do NOT re-enable — a newer run may own the UI). Set after the cancel frame is sent, cleared on the next submit / Reconnect. Do **not** loosen `isSelfHealingStatusMessage()` — its anchored matcher is itself the 2026-07-07 fix.

**Also fixed:** the Ask-Execs broker (`exec_permission.py`) now polls the run latch, so a Cancel raised while a Proceed/Deny modal is blocking resolves to **deny** instead of parking the worker forever (the button-stuck-on-Cancel mirror bug); `cancel-all` lowers the boolean too (a leftover `True` used to poison any later `setup_rag_chain()`); and a cancelled run's late answer is dropped **only** when a NEWER run is already in flight (otherwise it is still delivered, preserving the Exec report).

**Coverage:** `agent/test_cancellation.py` (24 tests — incl. `test_step8_race__clearing_the_boolean_does_NOT_uncancel_the_run` and the cross-user no-collateral-damage pair) + 3 new `test_self_healing.py` tests that reproduce the Step-1→Step-8 sequence verbatim and assert **no** further "Tactic" frame is ever emitted after a cancel.

### 2026-07-14 — Screenshot paste / drag-and-drop into the chat box (`chat_image_paste.js`)

**PrtScn → Alt+Tab → Ctrl+V now attaches a screenshot to the chat: the image is saved to `<app>/Temp` as `image_<timestamp>.jpg` and its ABSOLUTE PATH is spliced into the chat box at the caret, with a thumbnail chip above the input.** Dropping image files onto the chat column does the same. The point is to hand Tlamatini an image path she can pass to Image-Interpreter / `launch_view_image` in the very next prompt.

Surfaces: `agent/views.py::paste_image_view` (+ `_unique_chat_image_path`, Pillow → JPEG, alpha flattened onto white, 25 MB cap) · route `paste_image/` via `secure_post` in `urls.py` · `agent/static/agent/js/chat_image_paste.js` (self-contained IIFE, **no new cross-file globals** — respects the const-poison contract) · `#chat-image-chips` + `#chat-drop-overlay` in `agent_page.html` · `.chat-img-*` / `#chat-drop-overlay` CSS in `agent_page.css`.

Two contracts, both learned the hard way in the live visible test:

1. **`agent_page_layout.js` PINS `#tools-chat-form-container` to an explicit pixel height** (`toolsContainer.style.height = formPx + 'px'`, from `computeFormMinHeight()`). Anything you add INSIDE that container must be counted there, or it silently pushes the textarea + Send button off the bottom of the viewport. The chips row is measured (`chat-image-chips` offsetHeight) and the `ResizeObserver` now watches BOTH `tools-div` and `chat-image-chips`. **Do NOT add another row inside that container without extending `computeFormMinHeight()`.**
2. **The paste listener is on `document`, not on the textarea** — after Alt+Tab the focus is on `<body>`, so a textarea-scoped listener misses the flow entirely. The caret is remembered separately (`lastCaret`, updated on click/keyup/select/input/blur) so the path lands where the user left the cursor. **Drag-and-drop is scoped to `#main-chat-container`** on purpose: the External-MCP dialog installs its own document-level `.json` drop handler, and a document-level image handler would fight it.

Live-proven 16/16 (headed Chrome, real OS keystrokes, full-screen photos): real clipboard bitmap → `image_20260714_005340_168.jpg` (2560×1600, 199 KB) written to Temp, path inserted **mid-sentence at the caret**, thumbnail rendered, drop pipeline verified, chip `×` removes both the chip and its path, textarea + Send stay on screen.

Machine note (not a bug in Tlamatini): on Angela's Windows 11, **PrtScn opens the Snipping Tool overlay** instead of copying the screen to the clipboard. The snip still reaches the clipboard once taken, so the feature works; the overlay just sits on top and swallows keystrokes, which makes automated tests flaky — kill `SnippingTool.exe` / `ScreenClippingHost.exe` before driving the keyboard, and NEVER trust a clipboard check without emptying the clipboard first (a stale bitmap from a previous run will happily fake a pass).

### 2026-07-13 — Configurable web port `django_port` (v1.40.1) — do NOT re-hardcode 8000

**The web port is now `config.json` → `django_port` (default 8000), resolved in `Tlamatini/manage.py` and applied to EVERY launch path. Contract: `docs/claude/architecture.md` → *Configurable web port*. Coverage: `agent/test_django_port_config.py` (24 tests).**

- **The failure it fixes.** On a machine where Windows/Hyper-V has **RESERVED** port 8000 (a dynamic-port exclusion range — check with `netsh interface ipv4 show excludedportrange protocol=tcp`), Daphne cannot bind it and Tlamatini dies at startup with **`WinError 10013`** ("an attempt was made to access a socket in a way forbidden by its access permissions"). A **frozen install had no escape** — the port was baked into `manage.py`, so only a rebuild could move it. It is now one line of `config.json`.
- **Three helpers in `manage.py`, deliberately stdlib-only** (they run BEFORE Django is imported — do NOT make them import `agent.*` / `config_loader`): `_resolve_config_path()` (CONFIG_PATH env > next to the frozen exe > `agent/config.json`), `_resolve_django_port(default_port=8000)` (read + range-validate), and `_apply_configured_port(argv)` (inject into `sys.argv`).
- **Completion pass (this entry).** The original commit `4dc1d546` only wired the port into the **frozen** block, so `python manage.py runserver` (the documented source dev command) and `manage.py startserver` **still silently bound 8000 and ignored the key**. `main()` now calls `sys.argv = _apply_configured_port(sys.argv)` once, outside the frozen branch, so all five paths agree: frozen double-click, `.flw` association, frozen browser auto-open, source `runserver`, `startserver`.
- **Do NOT weaken these two invariants** (they are what the 24 tests pin):
  1. **Fail-open.** Missing key / missing file / unparseable JSON / non-numeric / out-of-range → fall back to **8000** and print `--- [PORT] …`. A config typo must NEVER stop the server from starting. Read with `utf-8-sig` (BOM-tolerant).
  2. **An explicit CLI port always wins.** `runserver 9100` / `runserver 127.0.0.1:9100` is never overridden, and the injector never double-appends onto the frozen `0.0.0.0:<port>` rewrite. The "did the user pass one?" test is *any non-flag token after the command* — do not simplify it to `len(argv) > 2` (that would treat `--noreload` as an address).
- **Bare port on purpose.** `_apply_configured_port` appends `"<port>"`, NOT `"0.0.0.0:<port>"`, so source mode keeps Django's **loopback** default host. Only the frozen paths deliberately bind `0.0.0.0`. Do not "normalize" them to the same string.
- **Out of scope, by design:** a direct `daphne`/`uvicorn` launch bypasses `manage.py` (pass the port on that CLI). The MCP helper listeners `:8765` / `:50051` are a separate axis with their own keys. The **TeleTlamatini** bridge has its own `tlamatini.base_url` — repoint it if you move the port.
- **Testing note:** `manage.py` CANNOT be imported in a test process (module-level console branding + the stdout/stderr tee + the Temp-dir pin). `test_django_port_config.py` therefore AST-lifts the three helpers and execs them in a clean namespace — the same "cannot safely be imported" trick `test_temp_dir_policy.py` uses. Keep it that way.

### 2026-07-12 — Tlamatini-FlowPills companion-app discovery (v1.40.0) — keep these surfaces, do NOT revert

**So the sister app `Tlamatini-FlowPills` can find Tlamatini's agent-template catalog at startup WITHOUT importing Python, running Tlamatini, or scanning drives, Tlamatini publishes three read-only, HKCU-only, fail-open surfaces. Engine: `agent/agent_manifest.py` + `agent/windows_app_registration.py`; wired into `apps.py`, `install.py`, `uninstall.py`, `build.py`. Contract: `docs/companion-app-discovery.md`. Codex reports: `Tlamatini-Moded-For-Flowpills.md` + `Tlamatini-Moded-For-FlowPills-2nd-Sprint.md`. Requirement source: `Tlamatini-FlowPills-Lookup.md` §15 + `Tlamatini-FlowPills-Lookup-2nd-Sprint.md`.**

- **The three surfaces.** (1) Registry key `HKCU\Software\XAIHT\Tlamatini` with six `REG_SZ` values (`InstallLocation`, `AgentsRoot`, `SourceAgentsRoot`, `AgentManifestPath`, `Version`, `AgentCatalogVersion` = `<count>-<sha8>`). (2) `_tlamatini_agents_manifest.json` next to the agents (complete templates only — `<type>.py` + `config.yaml`; `pools`/`__pycache__` excluded — each with a per-file `sha256`). (3) `.tlamatini-preserved-agents.json` left by the uninstaller when it preserves `agents/` (carries `manifest_path` + `manifest_sha256`).
- **Do NOT revert (second-sprint hardening):**
  - **`apps.py`**: discovery is scheduled **FIRST** in `AgentConfig.ready()` via the module-level `_schedule_companion_discovery()` — BEFORE `global_state` / the two MCP servers / `models` / ACPX are imported — with a **dedicated** idempotency gate (`_DISCOVERY_GATE_LOCK` + `_discovery_thread_started`), separate from `mcp_server_running`. Do NOT move it below the heavy imports and do NOT gate it on the MCP flag (an import/startup failure there must never suppress publication).
  - **`windows_app_registration.register_discovery_entry`** writes ALL SIX `REG_SZ` values on every call (empty when unknown) — never re-add the `if version:` / `if agent_catalog_version:` conditionals (they leave stale metadata behind). The agents-preserving uninstall KEEPS the key; only a full removal calls `unregister_discovery_entry()`.
  - **`agent_manifest.read_manifest`** uses `utf-8-sig` (BOM-tolerant); `ensure_manifest` re-hashes every complete agent file on each check and rewrites only when content differs (the volatile `generated_at` alone never rewrites).
  - **`install.py`**: companion registration is its OWN method `_register_companion_discovery`, called INDEPENDENTLY of `_register_programs_entry` (a missing `Uninstaller.exe` / an ARP failure must not skip it); the installer does its own `winreg` writes (it cannot import `agent.*`).
  - **`uninstall.py`**: `_write_preserved_agents_marker` writes `manifest_sha256` (computed AFTER re-stamping the manifest kind to `preserved`).
- **Filesystem is authoritative** — the manifest is diagnostic evidence only; keep it accurate but never let a stale/missing manifest gate a root pass/fail (FlowPills REQ-VAL-008).
- **Tests**: `agent/test_agent_manifest.py` (17 tests) is a plain `unittest.TestCase` (Django-FREE) so it runs SECRET-SAFELY via `python -m unittest agent.test_agent_manifest` (verified 0 tracked config files changed; `manage.py test` also passes, content-hash-guarded over 86 config files). Keep it Django-free and keep the HKCU backup/restore in the live registry tests.

### 2026-07-12 — Unreal Engine 5.8 project scaffolder + Unrealer material fixes (VS 2026) — keep these UE-5.8 / VS-2026 build fixes, do NOT revert

**Repos: the scaffolder + UE template live in the SEPARATE `XaihtUnrealEngineMCP` repo (`scaffold_unreal_project.py` + `MCPGameProject/`, git `XAIHT/XaihtUnrealEngineMCP`). The Tlamatini side is the Unrealer agent (`agent/agents/unrealer/{unrealer.py,config.yaml}`) + the Catalog-of-Prompts entry (`agent/migrations/0173_add_unreal_scaffold_demo_prompt.py` + `0174_unreal_scaffold_build_project_tip.py`, seeded `prompt-106`).**

- **New capability — one-prompt Unreal 5.8 scaffold.** `prompt-106` scaffolds a BRAND-NEW UE 5.8 C++ project (UnrealMCP editor plugin already wired, ready to open+build in **Visual Studio 2026**) from just TWO `[[ ]]` markers — the project NAME and the DIRECTORY (the "add-a-contact"-style placeholder pattern). It drives the deterministic `scaffold_unreal_project.py` (copy+rename the `MCPGameProject` template, set EngineAssociation 5.8, auto-discover UE 5.8 on disk even when unregistered, generate the VS `.sln`). **Proven live end-to-end:** scaffold → build green on 5.8 → editor auto-starts the UnrealMCP TCP listener on `127.0.0.1:55557` (a `UEditorSubsystem`) → the Unrealer agent drove `get_actors_in_level`.
- **UE-5.8 / VS-2026 build fixes (all in `XaihtUnrealEngineMCP`, all "do NOT revert"):**
  - **`Source/*.Target.cs`: `BuildSettingsVersion.V7` + `IncludeOrderVersion.Unreal5_8`** — `V6` is a hard UBT reject ("modifies shared properties") against 5.8's installed engine.
  - **`MCPGameProject/Directory.Build.targets` resets `<IncludePath>` / `<ExternalIncludePath>` to `$(VC_IncludePath);$(WindowsSDK_IncludePath)`** — VS 2026's v180 target `AddExternalIncludDirectoriesToPaths` pushes UE's ~35k-char include list into the `INCLUDE` env var → exceeds the **32,767-char Windows env-var limit** → `MSB4018: The SetEnv task failed unexpectedly / value is too long`. UBT passes includes to the compiler directly (ignores that env var) and IntelliSense uses `<NMakeIncludeSearchPath>`, so the reset is safe; it lives at the project root so it survives a project-file regen.
  - **`.uproject` EngineAssociation → 5.8; `UnrealMCP.uplugin` `WhitelistPlatforms` → `PlatformAllowList`; `UnrealMCPEditorCommands.cpp` `FImageUtils::CompressImageArray` → `PNGCompressImageArray` (into a `TArray64<uint8>`)** — real 5.8 API breaks caught by the live build.
  - **VisualStudioTools plugin (VS 2026 auto-injects Microsoft's MIT plugin on open):** its `VisualStudioToolsBlueprintBreakpointExtension.cpp` did `#include <BlueprintGraphClasses.h>` — an aggregate header Epic **REMOVED in 5.8** (IWYU) → C1083 + MSB3073 (Build.bat exit 6). Fix (Angela's, via Copilot/Fable 5, `AngysLastChance/fix.md`) = `#include <K2Node_CallFunction.h>` (only symbol used is `UK2Node_CallFunction`). **VS does NOT overwrite an already-present plugin**, so the durable fix = **bundle the pre-fixed plugin in the template** (`MCPGameProject/Plugins/VisualStudioTools/`, `EnabledByDefault:true`) + a defensive idempotent `patch_vs_tools_ue58()` in the scaffolder. In VS, **build the game PROJECT only, never "Build Solution"** (a full-solution build also compiles unrelated engine targets — LiveLinkHub, test harnesses — that fail for unrelated reasons and clutter the Error List); `prompt-106` step 4(b) now says exactly this (migration `0174`).
- **Unrealer agent correctness fixes (`agent/agents/unrealer/unrealer.py`, verified against the plugin C++):**
  - **`assign_material` slot was silently dropped** — the plugin reads `slot_index` (`HandleAssignMaterial`), the agent only exposed `slot`; added `'slot': 'slot_index'` to `_PARAM_ALIASES['assign_material']` so a non-zero slot no longer lands on slot 0.
  - **`material_path` was not `/Content`→`/Game` normalized** — the alias remap renames `material`→`material_path` BEFORE normalization runs, so `'material_path'` was added to `_CONTENT_PATH_PARAM_KEYS`.
  - **`config.yaml` plugin-source pointer corrected** — the "extended fork" comment now names `XaihtUnrealEngineMCP` (was the stale `C:\Development\unreal-mcp` base, which implements only ~34 of the catalogued commands).

### 2026-07-11 — Catalog of Prompts: the panel is CSS-pinned to the viewport — do NOT re-introduce JS positioning in `tools_dialog.js`

**Files: `agent/static/agent/css/tools_dialog.css` (`.modal-content`, `.modal-header`, `.modal-body`, `.modal-footer`, `.prompt-search-bar`) and `agent/static/agent/js/tools_dialog.js` (`positionModalNearCatalogButton()` — REMOVED).**

- **Bug (Angela, live):** with a large catalog (105 prompts), the `#prompts-catalog` modal grew straight off the **top** of the window and the **search box became unreachable**, and where it landed depended on how tall the user had dragged the chat textarea.
- **Two causes, both in the removed `positionModalNearCatalogButton()`:**
  1. It anchored the panel's **BOTTOM** to the "Catalog of prompts" button — `bottom = window.innerHeight - buttonRect.top`. That button floats above the chat textarea, so the panel's geometry literally tracked the **chat input's height** (the thing Angela explicitly wanted independence from).
  2. Its height clamp measured `modalContent.getBoundingClientRect()` while `.modal-content` was still at `transform: scale(0)` (a **0×0** rect, since `getBoundingClientRect` returns the *transformed* box). So `contentHeight` was garbage, `maxBottom` never engaged, and the panel overflowed the viewport upward.
- **Fix — geometry is now 100% CSS, zero JS measurement.** `.modal-content` is `position: fixed; top: 12px; left: 12px; bottom: auto; max-height: calc(100dvh - 24px)`, `transform-origin: top left`. It is anchored to the **VIEWPORT**, grows DOWNWARD, and can never exceed the window, so the header + search bar are always on screen at a **constant** y. `.modal-header` / `.prompt-search-bar` / `.modal-footer` are `flex: 0 0 auto` (never squeezed out) and `.modal-body` is `flex: 1 1 auto; min-height: 0; overflow-y: auto` — **`min-height: 0` is load-bearing**: without it a flex item's default `min-height: auto` refuses to shrink below its content, so the *panel* would stretch instead of the *list* scrolling. `.modal-footer:empty { display: none }` drops the stray divider the empty footer used to draw.
- **DO NOT** re-add JS `left`/`bottom` inline styles to `.modal-content` (they would override the stylesheet and resurrect both bugs), and do not measure a `scale(0)` element for layout.
- **Verified live (headed Chrome, real chat GUI, 105 cards):** panel top = 12 px, bottom = 938 of a 950 px viewport, list scrolls internally, search box on screen + clickable. Growing the chat textarea moved the Catalog **button** 835 → 1152 px while the **search box stayed at exactly 127 px** — i.e. provably independent of the chat input's vertical size.
- **Note (bit us during this fix):** the app Angela runs on `:8000` is the **frozen install `C:\Tlamatini\Tlamatini.exe`**, not the source tree — see the frozen-static note below/`memory: project_live_app_is_frozen_install`. A repo-only edit changes nothing she can see.

### 2026-07-11 — Plain `runserver` (reloader ON) no longer double-starts the MCP helper ports — do NOT remove the `RUN_MAIN` gate in `agent/apps.py`

**File: `agent/apps.py` (`AgentConfig.ready()`), plus the run-instruction docs (`README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `BookOfTlamatini.md`, `ACPX.md`, `KIMI.md`, `agent/doc_generation/complete_project_docs.py`).**

- **Bug (long-standing, never noticed):** `python manage.py runserver` **without** `--noreload` runs TWO processes — Django's autoreload **watcher** AND the **worker** — and BOTH execute `AppConfig.ready()`. `ready()` starts the two MCP helper servers (System-Metrics `ws://…:8765`, Files-Search `grpc :50051`), so they were started **twice**; the second bind failed with `OSError [WinError 10048]` ("only one usage of each socket address…") / gRPC "Failed to bind to address `[::]:50051`", printing two red tracebacks on **every** plain-`runserver` boot. The in-process `global_state('mcp_server_running')` guard cannot catch it — it is per-process, and the two reloader processes each hold their own copy. It stayed hidden for years because EVERY doc says to run `runserver --noreload`, and the shipped `.exe` uses the single-process `startserver`; only a developer who dropped `--noreload` from source ever hit it.
- **Fix:** immediately after the existing `should_start` gate in `ready()`, a reloader-awareness gate. Django sets `RUN_MAIN=true` ONLY in the worker child (the watcher parent leaves it unset), so:
  ```python
  _runserver_reloader = ('runserver' in argv) and ('--noreload' not in argv)
  if _runserver_reloader and _os.environ.get('RUN_MAIN') != 'true':
      return
  ```
  The watcher parent bows out; only the worker binds the ports (exactly once). `--noreload` / `daphne` / `asgi` / `startserver` are single-process (no reloader, `RUN_MAIN` unset) and fall through unchanged, binding once.
- **Do NOT revert / do NOT "simplify":** removing this gate reintroduces the double-bind crash on plain `runserver`. Do NOT reduce it to `if _os.environ.get('RUN_MAIN') != 'true': return` alone — that would wrongly SKIP startup under `--noreload` (which has NO `RUN_MAIN`), breaking the documented run mode and the frozen build. The docs' `--noreload` requirement is now softened to "optional" (both modes boot clean).
- **Same class, second site — `startserver` (2026-07-11 follow-up, found by the deep audit):** the custom `python manage.py startserver` dev command ALSO double-started the two MCP servers — `ready()` starts them (its `should_start` matches `startserver`) AND `startserver.handle()` spawned its OWN `run_mcp1` / `run_mcp2` threads, double-binding `:8765` (WinError 10048 → stderr) and `:50051` (silent gRPC bind-to-nothing on a parked `daemon=False` thread). Fixed by making `ready()` the SOLE owner: `handle()` now just `call_command('runserver', use_reloader=False)` and starts NO MCP threads (unused `sys`/`asyncio`/`mcp1_main`/`mcp2_serve` imports removed). **Do NOT re-add MCP thread starts to `startserver.py`.** (The frozen `.exe` launches via `runserver --noreload`, not `startserver`, so this was a dev-command-only defect.)

### 2026-07-08 — Const-poison incident + v1.38.1 hotfix: cross-file mutable JS globals MUST stay `let`; Catalog of Prompts now loads via `GET /agent/list_prompts/` — do NOT re-`const` the globals, do NOT drop the fallback probe loop

**Files: `agent/static/agent/js/agent_page_state.js` + `agent/static/agent/js/acp-globals.js` (mutable globals restored to `let`), `agent/static/agent/js/tools_dialog.js` + `agent/views.py::list_prompts_view` + `agent/urls.py` (new `/agent/list_prompts/` route, `secure_get`-wrapped), `agent/static/agent/js/agent_page_dialogs.js` (dialog hardening), `agent/templates/agent/agent_page.html` + `agentic_control_panel.html` (cache-busters `_statefix`/`_dialogfix`/`_promptfix`), NEW `agent/test_frontend_mutable_state.py` (146-line regression suite). Commits: incident `85ee4e6c` → fix `af356c31` → tag **v1.38.1** (package.json aligned by `08efa1d2`).**

- **Incident (2026-07-08, the "const-poison"):** an automated style pass rewrote runtime-reassigned CROSS-FILE globals from `let` to `const` in `agent_page_state.js` / `acp-globals.js` (the tools/agents/skills arrays, chat history, canvas running/validation state, busy flags). Per-file ESLint structurally CANNOT see cross-file reassignment, so lint stayed green while the browser died on load with `TypeError: Assignment to constant variable` — the chat page AND the ACP Workflow Designer were dead. (The same incident also left a 0-byte `db.sqlite3`; recovered by reverse-applying the commit + `migrate`.)
- **Contract (do NOT re-`const`):** every module-level global that ANY other JS file reassigns MUST be declared `let`. `agent/test_frontend_mutable_state.py` now guards BOTH the source tree AND the collected `staticfiles` copies against re-poisoning — the check ESLint cannot perform. The template cache-busters force every browser off the poisoned cached scripts; keep them until a future STATIC_VERSION rotation supersedes them.
- **Catalog of Prompts endpoint:** the primary load path is now **`GET /agent/list_prompts/`** (`views.list_prompts_view`) returning ALL `Prompt` rows ordered by `idPrompt` in ONE request — no more expected-404 console spam, and an `idPrompt` gap no longer hides the prompts after it. The legacy `prompt-1..N` probe loop is KEPT as the offline fallback and that fallback still breaks at the first gap — so demo-prompt migrations stay contiguous/append-only (`MAX_PROMPTS=256`) per `create_new_agent.md` Step 7.8.
- **Dialog hardening in the same fix:** the Configure-Mcps probe loop exits cleanly, the About-video `play()` promise is guarded, and Esc closes the About/Update overlays.

### 2026-07-07 — Self-healing LIVE status lines no longer flip the Send button back early (frontend); the run stays "Cancel" until the REAL answer — do NOT switch the matcher to a substring `includes`

**Files: `agent/static/agent/js/agent_page_ui.js` (new `isSelfHealingStatusMessage()`), `agent/static/agent/js/agent_page_chat.js` (new `else if` branch in `appendChatMessage`). Frontend/JS-only, so it was ALSO hot-patched into the frozen install's served copies `C:\Tlamatini\_internal\staticfiles\agent\js\{agent_page_ui,agent_page_chat}.js` (restart + Ctrl+F5 to serve — WhiteNoise `DEBUG=False` caches the file index at startup). Verified live on `c:\Tlamatini` with fault injection.**

- **Symptom (Angela):** during a self-healing run the Send button flipped back to **Send** and the controls re-enabled *while Tlamatini was still working* ("it apparently stops but keeps working"). The 2026-07-06 `register_status_broadcaster` streams first-person recovery lines ("🔁 Tactic #2 …", "⚠️ … switching to a different tactic", "✅ … continuing the run …") as ordinary `{type:agent_message, message, username:Tlamatini}` frames — **identical in shape to the final answer** — so in `appendChatMessage` they fell through to the catch-all `else` → `enableControlsAfterOperation()`.
- **Fix:** a new branch — `else if (isSelfHealingStatusMessage(message))` — renders the line but RE-ASSERTS `disableControlsDuringOperation()` (idempotent; its spinner is guarded) so the button stays **Cancel**; only the true final answer takes the `else` and re-enables. `isSelfHealingStatusMessage` strips leading non-letters then `startsWith('Tactic #') || startsWith("Tactic '")`.
- **Do NOT change the matcher to a substring `includes`.** `self_healing.py::recovery_preamble` prepends a "SELF-HEALING NOTE —" banner to the FINAL answer that QUOTES those same tactic lines (as `- <line>` list items); a substring match would then classify the final answer as a status line and stick the button on **Cancel forever** — a strictly worse bug. The anchored (start-of-message) match catches only a standalone status frame. The "🛑 You cancelled" line is deliberately NOT matched — after a cancel the controls SHOULD return.
- **Reproduce:** launch with `TLAMATINI_SELF_HEAL_FAULT_RATE=1` + `TLAMATINI_SELF_HEAL_FAULT_MODE=error` (`self_healing.py::_fault_config`); every model step's first attempt fails → a "🔁 Tactic #2" retry → recovers on attempt 2. Relaunch WITHOUT those vars for normal (un-slowed) use.

### 2026-07-06 — Self-healing model-step invoker (`agent/self_healing.py`) — she NEVER hangs, NEVER discards real work, NEVER lies about it; do NOT make a model failure silent

**Files: NEW `agent/self_healing.py` + `agent/test_self_healing.py`; `agent/mcp_agent.py` (`MultiTurnToolAgentExecutor` builds a per-request `self._healer = SelfHealingInvoker(...)` and routes EVERY model step through `self._healer.invoke(...)` — the no-tools answer, each tool-loop iteration, the repetition-breaker nudge/summarize, and the final wrap-up); `agent/rag/chains/unified.py` (`_invoke_unified_agent_with_retry` bubbles `ModelStepUnrecoverable` straight to the fallback instead of re-running the whole executor ladder); `agent/consumers.py` (registers a LIVE status broadcaster per Multi-Turn request). Live-validated by `Tlamatini/tests_e2e/` (injected-fault runs; reports under `Temp/self_healing_visual_report_*`).**

- **What it does:** every `llm.invoke()` / `bound_llm.invoke()` in the Multi-Turn executor is wrapped by a per-request `SelfHealingInvoker`. On a transient model failure it keeps trying DISTINCT recovery tactics (plain retry, back-off sleep, message-tail trim via `trim_messages`, plain-LLM fallback) up to `unified_agent_llm_step_max_tactics` (default **4096**, min 1). A per-attempt watchdog of `unified_agent_llm_step_timeout_seconds` (default **80 s**, min 15) ABANDONS a call that does not answer in time (`_run_with_watchdog` runs the step on a worker thread and never waits past the deadline) so she can NEVER hang. Only the **USER (Cancel)** or a fully-exhausted tactic ladder stops her — then it raises `ModelStepUnrecoverable(reason, attempts, tactics_tried)`.
- **Never discards real work (graceful degradation):** if `ModelStepUnrecoverable` fires AFTER ≥1 agent already ran (`self._tool_calls_log or self._exec_report_entries`), the executor FINISHES GRACEFULLY from that real work (`_degraded_answer_from_results(...)`) so the Create-Flow button + Exec report survive and the answer is TRUTHFUL. Only a pure-Q&A with nothing to preserve re-raises to the chain fallback — which is exactly why `unified.py::_invoke_unified_agent_with_retry` short-circuits `ModelStepUnrecoverable` to the fallback instead of re-running the whole expensive executor ladder.
- **Never silent, never lies:** `recovery_preamble(healer.recovery_events)` is prepended to the FINAL, persisted answer on EVERY exit path (they all funnel through `_build_result_dict`), so the user is ALWAYS told what Tlamatini went through — never a lying "no tools ran" / silent stall.
- **Live status while she retries:** `register_status_broadcaster(user_id, emit)` / `unregister_status_broadcaster` / `notify_user` push `agent_message` frames to THIS user's chat so she SEES the tactics being tried. `consumers.py` registers the broadcaster for EVERY Multi-Turn request (independent of Ask-Execs — keyed by the same `broker_key`, unregistered in the `finally`), and `mcp_agent.py` now ALWAYS forwards `executor_payload["ask_execs_user_id"]` (previously it was set only under Ask-Execs) so the healer always has a user id to emit to.
- **Config:** `unified_agent_llm_step_max_tactics` (4096) and `unified_agent_llm_step_timeout_seconds` (80) — read via `get_int_config_value`, both fail-safe-clamped to their minimums.
- **Do NOT** remove the recovery preamble, silence/swallow a model failure, or wait on a model call without the watchdog. That combination — never-hang + never-discard + never-lie — is the whole point.

### 2026-07-06 — Dropped the SUCCESS/FAILURE answer classifier; Create Flow now uses ONLY successful agents; Exec-report checkbox gated on Multi-Turn — do NOT re-add the classifier

**Files: DELETED `agent/services/answer_analizer.py`; `agent/services/response_parser.py` (removed the import, the classification block, and the `answer_success` broadcast); `agent/consumers.py` (dropped `answer_success` from the `agent_message` → WebSocket forward); `agent/static/agent/js/agent_page_chat.js` (removed the `answerSuccess` param + gate — the button now shows on `multiTurnUsed && _hasSuccessfulToolCalls`; `_normalizeChatFlowBeforeDownload` now posts a successful-only `tool_calls_log`); `agent/agents/teletlamatini/teletlamatini.py` (final-frame detection keys only on `multi_turn_used`); `agent/templates/agent/agent_page.html` + `agent_page_state.js` (`syncExecReportAvailability`) + `agent_page_init.js` + `eslint.config.mjs` (Exec-report checkbox disabled/greyed when Multi-Turn is off).**

- **Why (Angela, 2026-07-06):** the extra LLM round-trip that classified the whole answer SUCCESS/FAILURE added latency for no benefit. The Create-Flow button only ever needed "did any agent run successfully?", and the generated flow already filtered to `entry.success`. So the classifier was removed **entirely** — module, import, broadcast, frontend gate.
- **Create Flow contract now:** the button appears whenever Multi-Turn ran AND ≥1 tool call succeeded AND the user isn't anonymous (then the live-registry `_missingAgents` check). The `.flw` is built from **only** the `entry.success === true` calls — failed executions are never nodes. Do NOT reintroduce `answer_analizer.py` / `analyze_answer_success` / an `answer_success` frame field.
- **Exec-report checkbox:** now a hard Multi-Turn modifier in the UI too — `syncExecReportAvailability()` disables + greys it (mirrors `syncAskExecsAvailability`) whenever Multi-Turn is unchecked; wired on load, on every Multi-Turn `change`, and on the Step-by-Step force-enable. `isExecReportEnabled()` already returned `false` when Multi-Turn was off, so this is purely the UI making the dependency obvious. Keep the `syncExecReportAvailability` global in `eslint.config.mjs`.
- **Note — the per-tool SUCCESS/FAILURE verdict in the Exec report is a DIFFERENT thing and STAYS.** That verdict is computed per tool call from the tool result (`_invoke_tool`'s `call_success`); only the whole-*answer* classifier was removed.
- **Tests:** `agent.tests.AnswerClassifierRemovalTests` (module-gone + broadcast-omits-`answer_success`) plus reworked `ExecReportPersistenceTests` / `DiagramRenderingTests` / `agent.test_chat_bridge_bots` (no classifier mock). All green; `ruff` + `eslint` clean (0 errors).

### 2026-07-04 — Config ▸ Models dialog adapted to the TRIPLE-MODEL Image-Interpreter (3 fields + global seeding) — do NOT collapse back to one field

**Files: `agent/templates/agent/agent_page.html` (Configure Models… form), `agent/views.py` (`CONFIG_MODEL_KEYS` + new `CONFIG_MODEL_KEY_DEFAULTS` + `load_config_section_view` fallback), `agent/config.json` (`image_interpreter_model_2`, `image_merging_model`), `agent/tools.py::_seed_global_agent_defaults` (image_interpreter block).** The 2026-07-04 Image-Interpreter upgrade made the agent a triple-model pipeline, but the Config ▸ Models dialog still exposed ONE "Image interpreter" field. It now has THREE — **Image interpreter 1** (`image_interpreter_model`; key deliberately unchanged: it also still feeds the legacy in-process vision path in `agent/imaging/image_interpreter.py`), **Image interpreter 2** (`image_interpreter_model_2`, default `gemma4:cloud`), **Image merger** (`image_merging_model`, default `glm-5.2:cloud`).

- Wiring into the agent follows the Kalier "embedded client" pattern: `tools.py::_seed_global_agent_defaults` seeds the three globals as `interpreter_model_1` / `interpreter_model_2` / `merging_model` on every wrapped `chat_agent_image_interpreter` launch — BEFORE per-call assignments, so an explicit LLM/user value still wins. Canvas/.flw nodes keep using their own node `config.yaml`, exactly like Kalier's `server_url`.
- `CONFIG_MODEL_KEY_DEFAULTS` in `views.py` backfills the dialog when the two new keys are missing/empty (a `config.json` preserved across self-update from an older build) so Save — which requires ALL fields non-empty — never strands the user on an empty required field. Do NOT remove that fallback.
- A new model field needs BOTH surfaces in lock-step: the `data-config-key` input in the dialog form AND the key in `CONFIG_MODEL_KEYS` (load returns / save whitelists exactly that tuple; the JS is fully generic over the form).

### 2026-07-02 — Default cloud model switched: kimi-k2.7-code:cloud → glm-5.2:cloud (1M-token context) — the "transient network error" was really a context overflow

**Files: `Tlamatini/agent/config.json` (all six model keys), `check_private_data.py` + `test_check_private_data.py` (fallback → `glm-5.1:cloud`), `README.md` / `BookOfTlamatini.md` model pull lines, `TlamatiniJudgementDay.md` `answer_models`.** Root cause, proven in the frozen install's `tlamatini.log`: analyzing `C:\Tlamatini\applications\esphome` produced prompts of 309,270 tokens (project context load) and 262,307 tokens (Multi-Turn, ~iteration 52) against kimi-k2.7-code:cloud's 262,144-token ceiling — Ollama returned `400 "The prompt is too long"`, and the unified chains' fallback path (`rag/chains/unified.py` ≈353 / ≈832) prepends a SYSTEM NOTICE that labels ANY agent-invoke failure a "transient network error", so the answer told the user to retry something retrying can never fix. `glm-5.2:cloud` (verified on this host via `ollama show`: 1,000,000-token context, tools + thinking) absorbs both prompts with room to spare.

- The live install `C:\Tlamatini\config.json` was switched to glm-5.2:cloud the same day (Config ▸ Models); dev `config.json` now matches it.
- `check_private_data.py`'s fallback became **glm-5.1:cloud, NOT glm-5.2** — the primary is already glm-5.2 and `build_models` dedupes an identical primary/fallback pair (`test_build_models_dedupe`), so a same-model fallback would silently remove the safety net. Tests updated in lock-step (6 references).
- **Open work (do NOT forget):** the `unified.py` fallback notice still hardcodes "transient network error" for every failure cause; it should classify the exception (context overflow → "the loaded project / accumulated tool results are too large — reduce scope"; real socket error → retry advice). Until that lands, treat that phrase in an answer as UNRELIABLE — read `tlamatini.log` for the true error.

### 2026-07-02 — RELEASE runtime mode + useful-error contract + buffered log tee + gated hot-path tracing (FirstFinalPlanToSpeedUp.md speed batch) — do NOT revert

**Files: `Tlamatini/tlamatini/settings.py`, `Tlamatini/tlamatini/middleware.py`, `Tlamatini/manage.py`, `Tlamatini/agent/consumers.py`, `Tlamatini/agent/services/response_parser.py`.** Measured: `_TeeStream` 50k-line burst **0.396 s → 0.167 s (2.38×**; second sample 2.81×); release statics now serve `Cache-Control: max-age=60, public` + ETags (they used to ship with **NO cache headers at all** via Django's dev static handler); root page median 8.16 → 6.89 ms; source-mode after-run byte-identical to before (DEBUG=True, same null headers). Proofs: `manage.py check` + ruff clean in BOTH modes; `agent.tests_perf_3x` 116/116; `Temp/verify_release_errors.py` 15/15; `Temp/verify_tee_flush.py` 7/7.

- **RELEASE mode (`settings.py`)** — `DEBUG` is no longer unconditionally True: frozen installs default to `DEBUG=False`; source runs stay `DEBUG=True`; `TLAMATINI_RELEASE=1` makes a source run behave like a release build; `TLAMATINI_DJANGO_DEBUG` (=1/=0) is the emergency override in either direction. `ALLOWED_HOSTS=['*']` deliberately untouched (tightening it in release mode would 400 every request — that is a separate, careful pass; see the `tlamatini_allowed_hosts_tighten` skill).
- **WhiteNoise release branch rewritten honestly** — the old per-branch `STATICFILES_STORAGE` lines were DEAD on Django 5.1+ (the setting was removed in favor of `STORAGES`), and the manifest storage they *claimed* would have 500'd every `{% static %}` on the never-shipped `staticfiles.json` had it engaged. Release now = `WHITENOISE_AUTOREFRESH=False` (scan once at startup, no per-request stats), `WHITENOISE_MAX_AGE=60` (names are NOT hashed; `?v=STATIC_VERSION` busts on every server start), plus `WHITENOISE_USE_FINDERS=True` for NON-frozen release runs so `TLAMATINI_RELEASE=1` needs no collectstatic. Do NOT re-introduce a manifest storage without also shipping a manifest from `build.py`.
- **`NoCacheHTMLMiddleware` is now UNCONDITIONAL** — it used to be `if DEBUG:`, but DEBUG was always True, so unconditional is exactly the behavior every install has today. Do NOT re-gate it on DEBUG: release HTML would go heuristically stale after self-updates.
- **Useful-log guarantee (`LOGGING`)** — explicit `"django"` logger (INFO, console, NO `require_debug_true` filter), `"root"` console handler at `TLAMATINI_LOG_LEVEL` (default WARNING — catches asyncio/background-thread/third-party errors), and `"tlamatini.request"` (the middleware's logger). Without the explicit `django` entry, `DEBUG=False` makes Django's default debug-filtered console handler silently drop 500 tracebacks from the console → `tlamatini.log`. Do NOT remove these three entries when touching LOGGING.
- **`FriendlyErrorMiddleware` (`middleware.py`, inserted FIRST in `MIDDLEWARE` = outermost `process_exception`)** — in RELEASE, unhandled view exceptions return a small branded page (or JSON for Accept/XHR/JSON-body callers) with an 8-hex error id, and log `ERROR-ID <id>` + method/path/thread + FULL traceback via `tlamatini.request`. It passes `Http404/PermissionDenied/SuspiciousOperation/BadRequest` through (404/403/400 conversions intact), returns None in DEBUG (technical page unchanged), and is fail-open (internal failure → Django's default 500, which `django.request` logs). The friendly HTML reflects NO request-derived text (anti-XSS by construction).
- **Buffered `_TeeStream` (`manage.py`)** — the per-write `log_file.flush()` is deferred: flush on ~8 KB (`_FLUSH_THRESHOLD_BYTES`), ≥1 s (`_FLUSH_INTERVAL_SECONDS`), urgent markers (`ERROR/Error/Traceback/Exception/CRITICAL/Critical/FATAL/Fatal/!!!/❌/⛔` — error lines hit the file INSTANTLY, byte-proven), explicit `flush()`, atexit, and a 1 s idle-flusher daemon (`tlamatini-log-flusher`) so `tlamatini.log` never lags more than ~1 s even when the app goes quiet mid-burst. Class-level `_LOG_LOCK` serializes the stdout/stderr tees (they share one file handle). **The class must stay self-contained on `os/sys/time/threading` + builtins** — `Temp/bench_first_final_speedup.py` AST-extracts it with exactly that namespace (side-effectful setup like atexit/threads belongs in `_setup_log_tee`, never in the class).
- **Gated WS receive tracing (`consumers.py`)** — the two per-frame `>>> [RECEIVE]` prints (+ forced `sys.stdout.flush()`) run only under `TLAMATINI_WS_TRACE=1` (module-level `_WS_TRACE`). Errors, Tier-2 reaper notices and permission logs are NOT gated.
- **Gated full-answer dumps (`response_parser.py`)** — the three whole-answer prints (original / after-cleaning / final — the answer used to be dumped up to 3× per turn) run only under `TLAMATINI_LOG_FULL_ANSWERS=1` or `TLAMATINI_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG` (module-level `_LOG_FULL_ANSWERS`); short length-summary lines replace them by default. Error and per-step summary prints untouched.
- **Rollback levers (no code revert needed)**: `TLAMATINI_DJANGO_DEBUG=1`, `TLAMATINI_WS_TRACE=1`, `TLAMATINI_LOG_FULL_ANSWERS=1`, `TLAMATINI_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG|INFO`. Benchmark/verify artifacts live in `Temp/` (`bench_first_final_speedup.py` — run it with `--port 8801`, NOT the default 8765, which collides with the System-Metrics MCP server every spawned instance binds; `verify_release_errors.py`; `verify_tee_flush.py`; `first_final_speed_*.json`; `compare_*.json`).
- **Pre-existing, NOT from this batch**: the benchmark server log shows `no such table` tracebacks — the source-tree `db.sqlite3` is the known-empty dev DB (see the 2026-06-19 createsuperuser-wizard entry); the app already treats them as non-fatal, and they appeared identically before this batch.

### 2026-06-29 — Catalog of Prompts off-by-one: the dropdown silently hid `prompt-100` — do NOT revert

`static/agent/js/tools_dialog.js::loadPrompts()` enumerated the catalog with `for (let i = 1; i < MAX_PROMPTS; i++)` (`MAX_PROMPTS = 100`), so it loaded **prompt-1..prompt-99** and the **100th slot never rendered**. Latent for as long as there were ≤99 prompts; adding the Zavuerer "get-your-Zavu-key" wizard at `prompt-100` (migration `0163_add_zavuerer_get_key_wizard_prompt.py`) exposed it. Fix: the loop bound is now **`i <= MAX_PROMPTS`** (inclusive), matching the documented `MAX_PROMPTS` cap (100 at the time of this fix), so all contiguous slots show (the existing break-at-first-gap still stops early when a slot is genuinely missing). **Keep it `<=`** — reverting to `<` re-hides whatever sits in the last slot. Ran `collectstatic` so the running server serves the fixed loop. **Headroom — `MAX_PROMPTS` bumped 100 → 256 on 2026-06-29** (the catalog had hit 100/100 when the Zavuerer wizard took slot 100; 256 gives 156 free slots). The FOUR references that MUST stay byte-coherent on any future cap change: `tools_dialog.js` (the `const MAX_PROMPTS`), `CLAUDE.md`, `Tlamatini/.agents/workflows/create_new_agent.md`, and the `tlamatini-agent-creation` skill. The backend `load_prompt_view` has **NO** cap (it serves any `prompt-<N>` by `promptName`), so the frontend `MAX_PROMPTS` loop bound is the ONLY catalog ceiling.

### 2026-06-28 — 3X-speed plan L1 + L2 landed (Ollama serving-layer detector, warm embeddings handle, explicit keep_alive on basic/retrieval chains; reaper O(N) carried) — do NOT revert

**Context:** First execution slice of `surgical_improving_speed_of_Tlamatini_by_a_factor_of_3X.md` (repo root). Surgical, behavior-neutral speed work.

**L1 — Ollama serving layer (`agent/rag/factory.py`, `agent/gpu_perf.py`):**
- `factory._resolve_keep_alive()` mirrors `mcp_agent.py`'s `OLLAMA_KEEP_ALIVE` parsing (int → int, non-int duration string → verbatim, unset/empty → `-1`). Added `keep_alive=_resolve_keep_alive()` to BOTH `OllamaLLM(...)` constructors (`build_prompt_only_chain`, `build_retrieval_chain`). The Multi-Turn executor (`mcp_agent.py:544`) and `gpu_perf` already pinned the model; this extends the same resident-model contract to the basic/retrieval chains so KV cache survives between turns.
- **`OllamaEmbeddings` does NOT accept `keep_alive`** (verified against the installed `langchain_ollama`: `'keep_alive' in OllamaLLM.model_fields` is True, but False for `OllamaEmbeddings`). **Do NOT add `keep_alive=` to the `OllamaEmbeddings(...)` constructor** — it raises at runtime. The embedding model is kept resident via the `OLLAMA_KEEP_ALIVE` env var + `gpu_perf.pin_ollama_model`. `tests_perf_3x.py::test_no_keep_alive_kwarg_used` guards this.
- `factory._get_cached_embeddings(config, client_kwargs)` + `factory._EMBEDDINGS_CACHE` — a warm, reused embeddings handle keyed by `(model, base_url, token)`. Replaces the per-chain-build `OllamaEmbeddings(...)`. A Config→Models embedding-model switch changes the key and misses, so the switch still takes effect.
- `gpu_perf.detect_ollama_serving_issues(base_url)` + `_OLLAMA_SERVING_BANNER`, called from `apply_gpu_max_performance` before pinning. **Diagnostic ONLY** — it probes `/api/version` + `/api/tags` and, on a strong signal (version answers but tags fails / body mentions `llama runner`/`llama-server`), prints a loud banner that a broken/contended serving layer (usually a SOURCE-build Ollama racing the official install on 11434) is the cause of multi-minute stalls. **It NEVER kills a process** (do not "improve" it into an auto-kill). This targets memory `project_ollama_source_build_breaks_embeddings`.

**L2 — orphan reaper:** the O(N) `_build_proc_index` rewrite (`orphan_reaper.py:516`, 290× faster, memory `project_orphan_reaper_on2_freeze`) was already in the source tree; it is now committed + carried into the build. Do NOT revert to per-process `psutil.children()` rescans (the O(N²) freeze).

**Tests:** `Tlamatini/agent/tests_perf_3x.py` (116 hermetic non-visual tests — keep_alive matrix, embeddings singleton, the detector against a local stub HTTP server, reaper O(N) scale guard) + `Tests/test_perf_3x_visual.py` (24 Playwright scenarios proving no chat stall; needs the live server). Run: `python Tlamatini/manage.py test agent.tests_perf_3x`.

### 2026-06-20 — Create Flow: Windows-path config params corrupted (backslashes dropped) — JS `_parseKeyValuePairs` must mirror Python `_unquote_preserving_backslashes` — do NOT revert

**Symptom:** A flow saved with the chat **Create Flow** button stored a Globber node's `path` as `C:TlamatiniTemplatesTlamatiniProjectForSTM32F407G` (every `\` gone) for the real `C:\Tlamatini\Templates\TlamatiniProjectForSTM32F407G`. It hit EVERY path-bearing config field (path / repo_path / file / output_dir / config_path / …), not just Globber — they all flow through one parser.

**Root cause:** `agent/static/agent/js/agent_page_chat.js::_parseKeyValuePairs` (used ONLY by the Create-Flow-from-tool-calls path) treated `\` inside a quoted value as an escape introducer — it expanded `\n`/`\t` and, on an unrecognized escape (`\T`, `\P`, `\D`, …), did `buf += next`, which DROPPED the backslash. The live tool run was fine because the Python runtime parser `agent/tools.py::_unquote_preserving_backslashes` keeps every non-`\\`/non-quote backslash VERBATIM — so flow-gen and runtime disagreed, and the gap only showed in the saved `.flw`.

**Fix:** Made the JS escape handling mirror the Python decoder exactly — inside a quoted value ONLY `\\`->`\` and `\<outer-quote>`->`<quote>` decode, a doubled outer-quote -> one quote, and EVERY other backslash is kept verbatim (no `\n`/`\t` expansion, never drop a backslash). One change fixes all path params. The backend (`normalize_flow_payload` / `flow_compiler`, YAML+JSON) and the `.flw` load/dialog/re-save path were independently audited — already lossless.

**Keep aligned (parity pair):** `_parseKeyValuePairs` (JS) and `_unquote_preserving_backslashes` (Python) MUST decode identically — change one, change both, or Create Flow drifts from what the runtime executed. Shared limitation (consistent on both sides, NOT a regression): a path ending in a lone backslash inside single quotes (`path='C:\dir\'`) is ambiguous because `\'` reads as an escaped quote.

**Verified:** real JS (Node) vs real Python over 9 vectors (the bug path, UNC, the `\n`/`\t` trap, regex, quotes) all byte-match; ESLint clean; 4-agent adversarial round-trip audit green. Source + collected `staticfiles/agent/js/agent_page_chat.js` both updated. Not committed.

### 2026-06-16 → 06-17 — External MCPs era: universal MCP client (4 transports) + 8 supervisor tools + `external_mcp_wait` + MCP Doctor + full-surface Multi-Turn + Step-by-Step (v1.26.0, committed `51d3ebd`, pushed to `main`) — do NOT revert

A large Claude + Codex collaboration. Full design contract: `docs/external_mcp_bulletproof_architecture.md`; user/how-to docs: `docs/claude/mcp-tools.md`. The "do NOT revert / keep aligned" contracts:

- **External MCPs = a config-driven universal MCP CLIENT** (`agent/external_mcp_manager.py`, catalog `agent/external_mcps.json`). It is a THIRD, separate MCP mechanism — NOT the two `Mcp`-model context providers (`factory.py`), NOT the per-agent inline MCP clients (STM32er/Kalier), NOT ACPX. Do not wire an external server through `factory.py`. The catalog is **user state**: resolved next to `config.json` (`CONFIG_PATH` > frozen > source), read with `utf-8-sig` (BOM-tolerant), preserved across self-update + redacted in the self-modify snapshot. ≤5 active (`MAX_ACTIVE`).

- **Connects run OFF the chat-build path (do NOT make them synchronous).** `_warm_connect_async` kicks background-thread connects; `get_external_mcp_tools()` binds only ALREADY-live servers + re-lists per turn. A synchronous connect on the chat path is exactly the 12 s stall that once dropped the redis MCP. A bad / unreachable / unsupported server must degrade to a catalogued-with-reason entry — never crash, never hang.

- **Four transports, one shared surface.** `stdio` (`_StdioMcpClient`, original) + the network family `_StreamableHttpMcpClient` / `_SseMcpClient` / `_WebSocketMcpClient` (all subclass `_NetworkMcpClientBase`, which owns the MCP handshake, and all DUCK-TYPE `_StdioMcpClient`: `.alive/.tools/.call_tool/.refresh_tools/.close/.stderr_tail/.zero_tools_since/.proc=None`). `_make_client`/`_connect` dispatch by transport. `httpx` (http/sse) + `websockets` (ws) are imported lazily and are in `requirements.txt`. `tcp`/`named-pipe` are detected + diagnosed but NOT connectable yet (clear blocker, future adapter). Network clients have `proc=None` so the command watchdog's `external_mcp_root_pids()` skips them. To add a transport: subclass `_NetworkMcpClientBase` + wire `_make_client`; tests in `test_external_mcp_transports.py` (REAL loopback http/sse/ws servers).

- **The original 8 LLM supervisor tools became 10 on 2026-08-15 — keep every name-list coherent.** Original set: `external_mcp_status / reconnect / doctor / list_tools / call / import / set_active / wait`; current additions: `external_mcp_runtime_status / runtime_install`. Adding/removing one means updating ALL of: `external_mcp_manager._SUPERVISOR_TOOL_NAMES`, `global_execution_planner._external_mcp_force_names` (the `supervisor` set — force-binds them on MCP-setup intents), and the fallback set in `mcp_agent._is_external_mcp_tool_name`; plus `capability_registry._EXTRA_HINTS_BY_TOOL_NAME`. The executor reconciles the `ext__*` slice of `self.tools` per request via `mcp_agent._refresh_external_mcp_tool_surface` (the executor caches `self.tools` once, so tools that connect AFTER first build must be re-attached each turn).

- **`external_mcp_import` / `external_mcp_set_active` accept dict-or-string / list-or-string — do NOT narrow to `str` only.** The LLM naturally passes the JSON config as an OBJECT (and keys as a list); a `str`-only pydantic schema rejected the object and the model fumbled into "I need to pass it as a string, let me retry" (leaked into the answer). Schemas are `Union[Dict[str,Any], str]` / `Union[List[str], str]`; the funcs branch on the runtime type.

- **`external_mcp_wait` exists because a first-run Docker image pull is slow.** A NEW `docker run mcp/<x>` PULLS the image (tens of seconds); the model used to poll `external_mcp_status` ~3× and hit the repetition breaker → gave up → the server connected seconds later but the turn was already lost. `external_mcp_wait(server_key, timeout)` BLOCKS server-side (driving warm-connect + relist) until the server is ready, then returns. The step-by-step guidance + `set_active`'s `next_step` tell the model to wait, not poll-and-give-up. Do not remove it.

- **MULTI-TURN BINDS THE FULL ENABLED SURFACE — do NOT re-introduce planner narrowing.** `mcp_agent.CapabilityAwareToolAgentExecutor.invoke` (multi-turn branch) sets `selected_tools = list(request_tools)` (every enabled tool/agent/skill; ACPX still filtered by `filter_acpx_tools` per its checkbox). This fixed "I don't have a file-writing or shell tool bound this turn" occurring with 88 agents present (the planner's top-20 subset starved the operator loop). The planner still runs upstream (its `planner_summary` is still forwarded for ordering hints) but no longer DROPS a tool from the bind. The `MultiTurnBackgroundLaunchTests` were rewritten to assert this (a context_only plan no longer binds zero tools). **Cost trims that keep this affordable (do NOT revert):** (a) the system-prompt tool list is ONE short line per tool — `bind_tools()` already sends every tool's full name/description/params, so the full multi-line descriptions in the prompt were ~5k redundant tokens/turn; (b) `ChatOllama` is built with `keep_alive` (honors `OLLAMA_KEEP_ALIVE`, default -1) so the byte-stable system-prompt prefix's KV cache is reused between turns.

- **Step-by-Step (`step_by_step_enabled`) must stay in the `unified.py` payload-rebuild WHITELIST** (same drop-on-rebuild bug class as `exec_report_enabled` / `ask_execs_enabled`). Plumbing: browser `#step-by-step-enabled` → `consumers.py` → `rag/interface.py` → `rag/chains/unified.py` (whitelist) → `mcp_agent._build_system_prompt` (injects the guidance). `bypass_prompt_validation = multi_turn_enabled OR acpx_enabled OR step_by_step_enabled`.

- **MCP Doctor agent (#78)** — `agents/mcp_doctor/`, wrapped `chat_agent_mcp_doctor`, migrations 0141/0142/0143 (Agent row / `Chat-Agent-MCP-Doctor` Tool row / demo prompt id 81). Self-contained (no `agent.*` import). Static catalog triage that mirrors the manager's `_SUPPORTED_TRANSPORTS` + `diagnose_server` logic; emits `INI_SECTION_MCP_DOCTOR` and is registered in `parametrizer.SECTION_AGENT_TYPES` (+ the contract's `parametrizer_fields`). It is the canvas counterpart of the live `external_mcp_doctor` tool. Captured automatically in the Exec Report via `_resolve_exec_report_spec` (no `_EXEC_REPORT_TOOLS` entry needed).

- **UTF-8 redirect crash (any file-redirected Python run) — keep the reconfigure.** When stdout/stderr are REDIRECTED to a file on Windows, Python uses **cp1252** (strict) → a `→`/emoji/box glyph raises `UnicodeEncodeError` and the process DIES mid-run (this crashed the Playwright suite at test 4 and closed the browser — the em-dash survived because it IS in cp1252; the arrow is not). Fix = `sys.stdout/stderr.reconfigure(encoding="utf-8", errors="replace")` at the top of any such script + `PYTHONUTF8=1` at launch. (`run_test.py`'s `_log` has the same latent risk — keep redirected runs UTF-8.)

- **build.py:** `--collect-all httpx` + `--collect-all websockets` + `--hidden-import websockets.sync.client` (they run in the FROZEN Django process, not the carried Python — websockets has no other importer in the frozen graph). `external_mcps.json` ships via `optional_file_copies`, is in `apply_update.ps1 $Preserve` + the `self_update.py` docstring, and is redacted + in `REQUIRED_SNAPSHOT_FILES` in `copy_source_assets.py`. Both inclusion sweeps must stay CLEAN.

- **Verification:** unit/integration suites `agent.test_external_mcp_universal` + `…_transports` + `…_e2e` + `…_add_flow` + `agent.test_parametrizer_mcp_doctor` + `agent.test_step_by_step_mode`, PLUS the VISIBLE Playwright suite `.claude/skills/tlamatini-daily-chat-test/harness/mcp_playwright_suite.py` (reuses the daily-chat-test harness; drives the live UI through 10 no-key MCPs — memory/sqlite/redis/fetch/time/everything/sequentialthinking/filesystem/git/puppeteer — 10/10 PASS; login via `TLAMATINI_USER`/`TLAMATINI_PASS` env; launch it DETACHED via `Start-Process` + `dangerouslyDisableSandbox` so the Chrome renders on the real desktop and outlives the 10-min foreground cap).

### 2026-06-15 — Self-update PRESERVES + migrates the user DB; numpy/opencv embedded in BOTH Pythons (v1.23.0) — do NOT revert

Three coordinated changes (committed `00b85a2`):

- **numpy + cv2 must be embedded in BOTH Pythons.** The media agents (Recorder / Camcorder / AudioPlayer / VideoPlayer / Whisperer) run under the **carried** Python (`<install>/python`), NOT the frozen exe — so a missing `numpy` made them crash at runtime even though it was pinned in `requirements.txt`. `build.py` now (a) asserts `numpy` + `cv2` in `_CARRIED_PYTHON_REQUIRED_IMPORTS` (the carried-Python probe → the build ABORTS if absent), (b) lists them in the frozen-asset `_agent_libs` import verify, and (c) adds `--collect-all cv2` so OpenCV ships in the frozen `_internal` too (numpy is already handled by `pyinstaller_hooks/hook-numpy.py`). Do NOT remove these guards — they catch the exact "pinned-but-not-installed-in-the-carried-Python" gap that shipped broken media agents.

- **Self-update now preserves user data + migrates it.** Previously a self-update REPLACED `db.sqlite3` (it lives inside `_internal/`, so the top-level `$Preserve` set could not protect it) → the user's chat history + custom Tool/Mcp/Agent toggles reset on every update. Now `apply_update.ps1` step 3b copies the user's live `_internal/db.sqlite3` into the preserved `DB/ToLoad/` and drops `DB/post_update_migrate.flag`; on the next launch `manage.py::_apply_pending_db_swap` restores it and `_run_post_update_migrate_if_flagged()` runs `migrate` in a **CHILD process** (`agent/apps.py::AgentConfig.ready()` only starts the MCP servers for `runserver`/`startserver`/`daphne`/`asgi`, so the child `migrate` neither starts a second server nor recurses). Result: the new version's migrations (new agent / `chat_agent_*` tool / demo-prompt rows) apply to the user's data while history + toggles are KEPT. Keep the two preserve lists coherent (`apply_update.ps1 $Preserve` ↔ the `self_update.py` docstring) and do NOT "simplify" this back to replacing the DB — the `tlamatini-self-update-inclusion` sweep now recognizes this capture-and-migrate path as the third valid DB-delivery mode.

- **Docs/skill carriage:** `Tlamatini/.agents/workflows/create_new_agent.md` gained **Step 9** (self-update/self-modify carriage: a new agent auto-ships; a new dependency is the one manual case → `requirements.txt` + the two `build.py` guards + a `--collect-all`); `CLAUDE.md` gained a Claude-built-in → Tlamatini-tool correspondence table. Verify carriage with `sweep_self_modify.py` + `sweep_self_update.py` (both must exit CLEAN). Frozen installs need `python build.py` to pick up the `build.py`/`manage.py` changes.

### 2026-06-12 — FileCreator writes content BYTE-FOR-BYTE (verbatim + base64 channel) — do NOT re-route content through the generic value coercion

**Incident (Angela, screenshot):** `chat_agent_file_creator` wrote `FormValidatorGeneratingClass.java` and Eclipse/Maven lit up with dozens of `illegal escape character`, `unclosed string literal`, `unclosed character literal` errors. Root cause: every wrapped agent shares `agent/tools.py::_coerce_assignment_value` → `_unquote_preserving_backslashes`, which collapses `\\` → `\`, `\<quote>` → `<quote>` and a doubled outer quote → one quote (correct for shell/SQL/Python-literal payloads). For a **verbatim source file** that is exactly wrong: a Java regex `Pattern.compile("\\.")` — whose on-disk bytes are `"\\."` — got rewritten to `"\."`, an illegal Java escape. Backslash-dense files (Java/JSON/regex/JS) came out broken even though the Exec Report (raw pre-parse request) looked correct.

**Fix (keep all of it):**
- **tools.py `_extract_verbatim_assignment(request_text, key)`** — re-extracts one value from the RAW request reusing the SAME segment-boundary detection (`_split_assignment_segments` / `_split_assignment_segment`, so the multi-line upgrade + `and KEY=` splitting still apply) but strips ONLY the outer quote pair and decodes **nothing**. Returns `None` for unquoted/missing/truncated values (caller keeps the coerced value).
- **`_launch_wrapped_chat_agent`** — for `spec.template_dir == "file_creator"` only: if `content_b64` is empty, overwrite `runtime_config["content"]` with the verbatim re-extraction. **`file_path` deliberately keeps the normal coercion** (a Windows path genuinely wants `C:\\Temp` → `C:\Temp`); only `content` is forced verbatim. Wrapped in try/except — the verbatim path must never break a launch.
- **`agents/file_creator/file_creator.py` + `config.yaml`** — new `content_b64` field: a fully parser-immune base64 channel (alphabet `A-Za-z0-9+/=` has no quotes/backslashes), decoded to raw bytes and written in **binary** mode; takes precedence over `content`. The text path now writes with `newline=''` so `\n` is NOT translated to `\r\n` (byte-exact).
- **registry + prompt.pmt** — file_creator `purpose`/`example_request` now say content is written VERBATIM (do NOT escape backslashes/quotes; real newlines, not `\n`), and document `content_b64` for backslash-heavy/binary files. The old `content='server:\\n …'` example (which taught misleading double-escaping) is now real newlines.

**Scope guard:** this is FileCreator-only. Do NOT make `_coerce_assignment_value` verbatim globally — pythonxer/keyboarder/sqler rely on the shell/SQL decode. Regression: `AssignmentParserRobustnessTests.test_verbatim_keeps_java_regex_backslashes` (+ content-first / unquoted cases). Proven end-to-end byte-exact (generic coercion = corrupt, verbatim + both channels = exact). Frozen builds need `python build.py` (tools.py is in the PYZ); a source instance just needs a server restart (`runserver --noreload`).

### 2026-06-12 — Wrapped chat-agent parser: dynamic multi-line upgrade on interior newline — do NOT revert (truncated-file bug)

**Incident:** `chat_agent_file_creator` wrote `SecurityHeadersFilter.java` (SuperDemoPage) truncated at `"default-src 'self` — exactly at the first `';` sequence — while the Exec Report showed the complete file (the report renders the RAW pre-parse request via `_extract_exec_report_command`, so it can never reveal a parse truncation).

**Root cause (core, NOT FileCreator):** in `agent/tools.py`, `_is_multiline_quote_open()` marks a quoted value multi-line only when a newline IMMEDIATELY follows the opening quote. LLMs routinely start the payload on the same line (`content='package com…`), leaving the value in single-line mode — where `_closes_outer_quote()` treats any interior quote followed by `,`/`;` as the closer. Java/CSS/JS payloads containing `'self';` (CSP literals) hit this every time.

**Fix (keep):** both `_split_assignment_segments` and `_split_assignment_segment` now have an `elif char == '\n': quote_multiline = True` branch inside their `if quote_char:` state — the moment a newline is consumed INSIDE a quoted value it upgrades to the strict multi-line closer rule (EOF or `and|with KEY=` only). Values without interior newlines behave byte-identically to before. Regression test: `AssignmentParserRobustnessTests.test_same_line_multiline_content_with_quote_semicolon_not_truncated` (byte-faithful incident repro). Also fixed the pre-existing `, OR window_width=` → `, OR with window_width=` drift in VideoPlayer's `example_request` (`chat_agent_registry.py`) that broke `test_every_registry_example_resolves_against_its_template`. Frozen builds need `python build.py` to pick this up (tools.py is in the PYZ).

### 2026-06-12 — `build.py --self-modify` now GENERATES the TlamatiniSourceCode snapshot via `copy_source_assets.py` — do NOT revert to the static copytree

**Directive (Angela):** the self-modify source tree must carry **ALL the source assets** needed to take → modify → integrate → regenerate `Tlamatini.exe` (build scripts, every `.ps1`, every `.py`/`.css`/`.js`, ...), omitting `.pdf`/`.pptx`/images/videos and files already duplicated in the installed tree, so Tlamatini can rebuild herself end-to-end.

- **`copy_source_assets.py` (repo root)** is the single generator. `build.py`'s `if self_modify:` branch imports it and generates `dist/manage/TlamatiniSourceCode` FRESH from the live repo on every `--self-modify` build; the old static copy of `Tlamatini/agent/TlamatiniSourceCode/` (a README-only placeholder) survives only as the exception fallback inside that branch. Do **not** restore the placeholder copytree as the primary path, and do **not** start populating `Tlamatini/agent/TlamatiniSourceCode/` by hand — it would drift from the repo instantly.
- **Denylist, not allowlist.** Unknown future TEXT file types must flow into the snapshot by default. New heavy/secret/generated artifact types are excluded by ADDING to `EXCLUDED_EXTENSIONS` / `EXCLUDED_DIR_NAMES` / `EXCLUDED_FILE_NAMES` in `copy_source_assets.py` — never by switching to an include-list.
- **Build-required binaries are KEPT on purpose:** `.ico` (build.py `--icon` + console icon), `.wav` (shipped UI sounds), `.svg`. Removing them breaks or degrades a rebuild.
- **Omitted-but-required binaries live in `RESTORE_FROM_INSTALL`** (currently `jd-cli/jd-cli.jar` and `agent/static/agent/video/XAIHT-Tlamatini.mp4`) and are written into the snapshot's `_REBUILD_INSTRUCTIONS.md` + `_SOURCE_SNAPSHOT_MANIFEST.json`. If build.py grows a new required binary input, add it to that map — otherwise a self-rebuild dies at the `FileNotFoundError` guards.
- **Secret redaction is a safety net, keep it:** `agent/config.json` (JSON deep-walk) and `agents/*/config.yaml` (line regex) are scrubbed to regen_secrets-style `<KEY goes here>` placeholders. The key matcher is SUFFIX-based on the last underscore segment precisely so `max_tokens` / `sample_rate` / `request_timeout` are never touched — don't loosen it to a substring match.
- **Recursion guard:** `TlamatiniSourceCode` is in `EXCLUDED_DIR_NAMES` so a snapshot never snapshots itself (and a rebuild FROM a snapshot regenerates a clean next-generation snapshot). Keep it there.
- Verified live 2026-06-12: 685 files / 9.84 MB / 0 errors / 0 leaked keys. Full before/after + rollback in `PIVOT_CHANGES.md` (2026-06-12).

### 2026-06-07 — A wrapped chat-agent is now gated by BOTH its Agent row AND its wrapper Tool row — do NOT drop the agent-row gate

**Directive (Angela):** disabling an agent in **Configure Agents** (its `Agent` row) OR disabling its wrapper in **Configure Mcps/Tools** (the `Chat-Agent-<Name>` `Tool` row) must make that agent **invisible to the LLM** — asked to use it, the LLM should report it as unknown/nonexistent. Example: unchecking **Talker** in Configure Agents, or **Chat-Agent-Talker** in Configure Mcps, must hide `chat_agent_talker`.

**Before:** `get_mcp_tools()` gated each wrapped chat-agent ONLY on its Tool-row flag (`tool_chat-agent-<name>_status`). The Agent-row flag (`agent_<name>_status`, set in `factory.setup_llm` from `agentContent`) was computed but **never consulted** — so unchecking the agent in Configure Agents did nothing; the tool stayed bound.

**Fix (`agent/tools.py::get_mcp_tools`):** the wrapped-agent loop now binds a `chat_agent_*` tool ONLY when BOTH flags are enabled — `tool_<desc>_status` (wrapper Tool row) AND `agent_<display>_status` (Agent row, via new `_agent_status_key`, mirroring `factory`'s `agent_<descr.lower()>_status`). Both gates **fail OPEN** (a spec whose `display_name` maps to no Agent row, or that has no Tool row, defaults to enabled) so only an EXPLICIT disable hides a tool. This is authoritative: the planner and executor only ever see `get_mcp_tools()` output, so a disabled agent is never planned, bound, or described to the model. Relies on the naming convention (`display_name` == `agentDescription`) — see `feedback_agent_naming_conventions`.

**Direct @tool agents too:** the same Agent-row gate was added to the direct @tools that map 1:1 to a canvas agent — `execute_command`→Executer, `execute_file`→Pythonxer, `googler`→Googler — so disabling the canvas agent hides BOTH its wrapped `chat_agent_*` AND its direct tool. (`decompile_java`/`unzip_file` have no exact-name Agent row, so they stay tool-gated via fail-open.)

**Tests:** `tests.py::WrappedAgentVisibilityGatingTests` (6) — Talker visible only when both enabled; hidden when the Agent row is off, when the wrapper Tool row is off, or both; a generic Shoter spot-check; and the direct-tool `execute_command`→Executer gate. **Note** `create_new_mcp.md` assumption #12 was corrected: wrapped chat-agents **do** have `Tool` rows and ARE gated (the old "always-on, not in the Tool table" claim was outdated).

**Deployment:** source-only; restart the Django chat server to pick up `tools.py`. Frozen needs `python build.py`.

### 2026-06-07 — Exec Report now captures EVERY Multi-Turn agent (observational + newly-created included) — do NOT re-add the "state-changing only" gate

**Bug (user-reported, with screenshot):** a Multi-Turn run of the Talker demo prompt with **Exec report ON** produced **no Exec-report tables at all** — only the LLM's own prose tables. Root cause: the Exec report only captured tools listed in `_EXEC_REPORT_TOOLS` (a curated whitelist of *state-changing* agents). Talker — and the whole observational/output family (Shoter, Camcorder, Recorder, AudioPlayer, VideoPlayer) and the read-only LLM agents (Crawler, Prompter, Summarizer, File/Image interpreters, Monitor-*, Recmailer, Asker, Sleeper) — were **intentionally excluded**, so they generated zero rows.

**Directive (Angela, emphatic):** the Exec report must show **every agent that actually runs during a Multi-Turn request** — observational/output and read-only agents INCLUDED — **and every newly-created agent**, automatically.

**Fix — generic auto-capture in `agent/mcp_agent.py::_resolve_exec_report_spec(tool_name)`:** resolves (1) the curated `_EXEC_REPORT_TOOLS` map first (still wins — shared agent_keys that merge a direct @tool with its wrapped launch, nicer display casing, CSS-matched caption gradient), then (2) a generic fallback that captures ANY wrapped `chat_agent_*` not in `_MANAGEMENT_TOOLS`, deriving `agent_key = spec.key` (separators stripped) and `agent_display = spec.display_name` from `WRAPPED_CHAT_AGENT_BY_TOOL_NAME`. Both `_invoke_tool` capture points (success + exception paths) and the Ask-Execs permission-detail display now call this resolver instead of `_EXEC_REPORT_TOOLS.get(...)`. **`_EXEC_REPORT_TOOLS` is no longer the gate for *whether* an agent is captured — only an optional styling/merge refinement.** Excluded (never captured): `_MANAGEMENT_TOOLS` polling helpers (`chat_agent_run_*`, `window_present`, `agent_stat_getter`, `get_current_time`) and direct read-only @tools (`googler`, `launch_view_image`).

**Rendering:** `agent_page.css` `.exec-report-caption` got a **readable DEFAULT background** (light slate gradient, dark text) so a newly-captured agent with no per-agent gradient rule still renders a clean caption. Per-agent caption gradients remain optional polish.

**Tests:** `tests.py::ExecReportCaptureTests` — rewrote `test_read_only_tool_calls_are_not_captured` → `test_observational_agent_captured_but_management_and_direct_readonly_not` (crawler now captured; run_status + googler not), and added `test_every_multiturn_agent_is_capturable_including_observational` (AUDIT: fails if ANY wrapped chat-agent resolves to no row). The 5 `test_not_in_exec_report` tests in `test_{talker,audioplayer,camcorder,recorder,videoplayer}_agent.py` were inverted to `test_captured_in_exec_report`. 163 tests green; ruff clean.

**Docs/skills updated (do NOT revert the "every Multi-Turn agent must appear" mandate):** `docs/claude/exec-report.md` (Scope completeness contract + "Adding an agent" mandatory-verify), `create_new_agent.md` Step 7.6, `.claude/skills/tlamatini-agent-creation/SKILL.md` Phase 15, `.mcps/create_new_mcp.md` Step 4 + file-scope + checklist + assumption #14.

**Deployment:** source-only. The running **Django chat server must be restarted** to pick up the `mcp_agent.py` change (source mode reads it fresh on start; it's not the MCP-bridge process). Frozen build needs `python build.py`.

### 2026-06-07 — Talker is FEMALE-ONLY by design: a male voice HARD-CRASHES the agent — do NOT relax, re-add male voices, or pass-through unknown voices

**Directive (user, emphatic):** Tlamatini is female and her Talker TTS must **NEVER** speak with a male voice — **not even when the user explicitly asks**. A male/non-female request must NOT degrade gracefully and must NOT substitute a female voice: the agent **closes its execution entirely** and reports that a male voice is forbidden by design ("⛔ MALE VOICE IS FORBIDDEN BY DESIGN … ⛔ NOW CLOSING.. BYE"). Better to crash than to ever sound male. The user also forbade any *enumeration of male synonyms* ("man/boy/guy") in the code — Tlamatini's vocabulary contains only female.

**Design (POSITIVE allow-list, fail-closed) in `agent/agents/talker/talker.py`:**
- `_FEMALE_VOICES = (tara, leah, jess, mia, zoe)` are the ONLY permitted voices; `_FEMALE_GENDER_TOKENS` the only accepted genders; `_VOICE_GENDER = {v: 'female'}` (no male keys); `_DEFAULT_VOICE_BY_GENDER = {'female': 'tara'}` (no male mapping). There is deliberately **no list of male voices/genders** — anything not verifiably female is simply "not permitted".
- New exception `MaleVoiceForbiddenError`. `resolve_voice()` raises it for (a) a non-empty non-female `gender`, (b) an explicit non-female `voice`, OR (c) **any unknown/unverifiable voice** (no more "pass unknown through with a warning" — Tlamatini never gambles on a voice she can't confirm is female). `resolve_voice` is called **FIRST** inside `synthesize()`, before any text/Ollama/audio work, so a forbidden voice can never fetch a token or play a sound.
- `main()` catches `MaleVoiceForbiddenError` **before** the generic `except` and calls `_die_male_voice_forbidden()` → logs the CRITICAL banner, emits a single `INI_SECTION_TALKER` error block (`voice: FORBIDDEN`, `status: error`), then `os._exit(70)` — closing the whole process, **NOT** triggering `target_agents`. (Exception-then-`os._exit`, not an inline `os._exit` in `resolve_voice`, so the unit tests can assert the refusal without killing the test process.) `emit_parametrizer_error_section` uses the non-raising `_safe_report_voice()` so it can describe a refused request without re-raising.

**Mirrored across the WHOLE source so the rule is unmissable (keep these aligned):** `config.yaml` (female-only header + only female voices documented), `chat_agent_registry.py` (Talker `purpose`/`example_request` — removed the `voice='leo'` example, state the refusal), `prompt.pmt` **Rule 17 "Talker voice rule — FEMALE ONLY"** (Conflict-resolution rule renumbered 17→**18**; `test_temp_dir_policy.py` updated to assert 17 Talker / 18 Conflict), `agents/flowcreator/agentic_skill.md` #74, `agents/flowhypervisor/monitoring-prompt.pmt` (do NOT flag the by-design shutdown as a crash), `agents_descriptions.md`, `README.md`, `docs/claude/agents.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `agent/Tlamatini.md` (§1 self-knowledge), and `agent_page_chat.js` (the `.flw` Flow-Generator drops a non-female voice/gender as defence in depth).

**Tests (`agent/test_talker_agent.py`):** the old male-voice expectations were rewritten to female; added the refusal contract (every male voice, every non-female gender, unverifiable voice, build-prompt refusal, synthesize-before-network refusal, and the `main()` hard-exit-`os._exit(70)`-no-downstream test) plus registry/config doc asserts; and a **`TalkerFemaleVoiceAudibleTests`** class — 5 REAL, AUDIBLE synthesis tests, one per permitted female voice (tara/leah/jess/mia/zoe; no mocks: real Ollama → real SNAC → real speakers), guarded by `skipUnless` so they skip where Ollama / the Orpheus model / snac+torch are absent. The audible tests use ONLY her female voices; a non-female voice is exercised solely by the refusal/abort paths.

**Verified LIVE** via the tlamatini MCP `talker` tool: `voice=leo` → return code **70**, banner + `status: error`, `played: false`, **no audio**; `voice=tara` → return code 0, `status: spoken`. **Deployment:** source-only edits; the MCP server runs from `C:\Development\Tlamatini` source so it is already live, but a **frozen build needs `python build.py`**. Memory: `project_talker_female_voice_only`.

### 2026-06-06 — Autonomous Command Watchdog: an idle/hung shell child can no longer freeze the whole chat — do NOT revert to "the per-call timeout is enough"

**Problem (user-reported, "Tlamatini is hanged, the same as last time"):** a Multi-Turn run wedged the entire chat. Root cause in the field: the LLM issued `execute_command` with a malformed `cmd /c "powershell -Command "...""` whose **mangled nested quotes** dropped PowerShell to its `>>` continuation prompt, where it **sat idle waiting on stdin that never came**. The synchronous tool call blocked the Daphne worker thread behind it. Confirmed live: `cmd.exe`→`powershell.exe` children of the main PID alive for minutes, main process blocked, `tlamatini.log` frozen mid-iteration.

**Why the existing nets didn't save it:** `tools._run_command_bounded` (stdin→DEVNULL + 600 s hard timeout + tree-kill) is the right *primary* fix and is in source — BUT (a) the frozen `C:\Tlamatini` build predated it (never rebuilt), and (b) even with it, 600 s is a very long freeze, and any path that bypasses it is unguarded. The `orphan_reaper` Tier 1/2 hooks **run on the same worker thread** that is blocked, so they can never fire during the hang.

**Fix — a new, independent daemon thread (`agent/command_watchdog.py`):** started once from `apps.AgentConfig.ready()` (right after the gpu_perf boot, same `should_start` gate, fail-open). It cannot itself be blocked by the hang because it lives off the worker thread. Every `tick_seconds` it enumerates `psutil` descendants of `os.getpid()`, and for any **console interpreter** (`cmd.exe`/`powershell.exe`/`pwsh.exe`) that is **alive past `hang_grace_seconds` AND making no PROGRESS** it kills the **whole tree** (descendants first), unblocking the worker. Defaults: tick 15 s, grace 180 s, 4 idle ticks, progress floor 0.10 cpu-s / 64 KB per tick — tunable via optional `config.json` keys `command_watchdog_{enabled,tick_seconds,hang_grace_seconds,required_idle_ticks,progress_cpu_seconds,progress_io_bytes}`.

**Progress (NOT elapsed time, NOT just the shell's CPU) is the kill criterion — this is what keeps long-but-working jobs safe.** Each tick the watchdog sums two monotonic counters across the **entire subtree** (the shell PLUS every descendant): CPU-seconds (`cpu_times().user+.system`) and I/O bytes (`io_counters()` read+write+other). A tick is "idle" only if BOTH advanced by less than the per-tick floors. A process is killed only when it has been idle for `required_idle_ticks` *consecutive* ticks AND is older than the grace window. Why each "working" case is spared: a CPU-bound build → CPU climbs; an I/O-bound download/clone at ~0 % CPU → bytes move; a launcher shell (`cmd.exe`→`python.exe`) whose CHILD does the work → the subtree is busy even though the shell is idle; a process we can't sample at all (AccessDenied) → treated as working. Only a tree that burns no CPU and moves no bytes for the full window — a shell stuck at a prompt waiting on input that never comes — is reaped.

**Safety contract (do NOT weaken):**
- **Progress-based, subtree-aware kill.** NEVER kill on duration. A child that consumes CPU OR moves I/O — anywhere in its subtree — is spared no matter how long it runs. Busy-but-runaway commands stay bounded by the separate 600 s ceiling in `_run_command_bounded`. The two layers compose; the watchdog is the FAST net for the no-progress stdin-wait hang, the bound is the backstop for a genuinely runaway busy command.
- **Hard-protected PIDs:** reuses `orphan_reaper._ancestor_pids` + `_console_owner_pid` so it can never kill our own window host, an ancestor, or the main process (would strand/close the server).
- **Scope:** only console interpreters (+ their descendants). Never the Python agent runtimes, the Daphne worker, or MCP/gRPC threads. `conhost.exe` is reaped via the interpreter's tree-kill, not directly.
- **Fail-open / never raises:** psutil missing → silent no-op; a tree it cannot sample is treated as *working* (spared), not killed; the loop swallows every error.

**Residual edge (be honest):** a command that genuinely blocks with ZERO local CPU and ZERO I/O for the full grace window (e.g. waiting on a very slow remote server / a held lock) would be treated as hung. Mitigation: the grace + idle-streak defaults are generous (≈ several minutes of total no-progress) and all thresholds are config-tunable; raise them for an environment with legitimately long silent waits.

**Takes effect only after `python build.py` + reinstall** — the running frozen `C:\Tlamatini` build also still lacks the source-side `_run_command_bounded` fix, which is the other half of why it hangs. Coverage: `agent/test_command_watchdog.py` — 15 tests incl. real-process tests proving the real watchdog (real psutil + real tree-kill) KILLS a stuck idle PowerShell but SPARES a CPU-bound one AND an I/O-bound one, plus a fake-process unit proving an idle shell with a busy CHILD is spared (subtree rule). Files: `agent/command_watchdog.py` (new), `agent/apps.py` (boot wiring), `agent/test_command_watchdog.py` (new).

### 2026-06-05 — Pool agents now ALWAYS run on a Python CARRIED inside the install (no system Python required) — do NOT revert to PYTHON_HOME/PATH resolution

**Problem (user-reported):** the frozen installer assumed the end user already had Python 3.12.10 **with all of `requirements.txt` installed** and discoverable via `PYTHON_HOME`/PATH. The PyInstaller `Tlamatini.exe` is self-contained, but **every pool agent (all ~74) is launched as a SEPARATE subprocess** via `get_python_command()` (in each agent) / `_resolve_python_executable()` (`views.py`, `tools.py` ×2, `chat_agent_runtime.py`), which resolved `PYTHON_HOME` → `<exe_dir>\python.exe` → bare `python`. The installer never installed Python, set `PYTHON_HOME`, or pip-installed deps — so on a clean machine **no agent could run** (and even a bare python from python.org lacks `langgraph`/`langchain`/`pyyaml`).

**Fix (two halves):**
1. **Ship a self-contained Python next to the exe.** `build.py::bundle_carried_python()` copies a **verified Python 3.12.10** (full install, NOT a venv, with deps importable) into `dist/manage/python/`. Hard preflight (`_probe_carried_python`) **ABORTS the build** unless the source interpreter is *exactly* `CARRIED_PYTHON_VERSION = (3,12,10)`, non-venv, and can `import yaml,langgraph,langchain,requests`. It flows to the install dir automatically via the existing `os.walk(dist_manage)` → `pkg.zip` → `install.py` `extractall` pipeline — **no `install.py`/`build_installer.py` change needed**, the result is `<install_dir>\python\python.exe`.
2. **Make every resolver prefer the carried interpreter UNCONDITIONALLY.** The shared helper **`get_user_python_home()` (62 agents + `views.py`)** now, in frozen mode, returns `<install_dir>\python` when `<install_dir>\python\python.exe` exists — BEFORE any registry/env `PYTHON_HOME`. Since `get_python_command()` and `get_agent_env()` (child PATH) both call it, this fixes interpreter selection AND PATH everywhere with one function. `cleaner.py` (has `get_python_command` but no helper) + the 3 app-side resolvers (`tools.py::launch_in_new_terminal`, `tools.py::_resolve_python_executable`, `chat_agent_runtime.py::_resolve_python_executable`) were patched directly to the same `<exe_dir>\python\python.exe`-first rule. **Proven by test: the carried python wins even against a hijacked `PYTHON_HOME`.**

**Also carried (full self-containment, "size doesn't matter"):** (a) **Playwright browsers** → `build.py::bundle_playwright_browsers()` copies `%LOCALAPPDATA%\ms-playwright` to `dist/manage/ms-playwright`; `manage.py::_pin_playwright_browsers()` exports `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` (Playwrighter + in-process Googler). (b) **Java** → `bundle_java_runtime()` copies `$JAVA_HOME` to `dist/manage/jre`; J-Decompiler. (c) **Git** → `bundle_git()` copies the Git-for-Windows root to `dist/manage/git`; Gitter + STM32er MCP clone. `manage.py::_pin_bundled_tools()` sets `JAVA_HOME` + prepends `jre/bin` & `git/cmd|mingw64\bin|usr\bin` to PATH (inherited by every agent via `os.environ.copy()`). `jd-cli/jd-cli.bat` no longer hardcodes a dev `JAVA_HOME` (resolves ambient or `%~dp0..\jre`). **Stays external by necessity:** Ollama (+models), STM32CubeIDE, runtime-downloaded firmware toolchains, remote infra targets (Docker/k8s/SSH/SCP/SQL/Mongo), ACPX external CLIs.

**Contract (do NOT weaken):** the carried interpreter is **EXCLUSIVELY 3.12.10** and is the **mandatory, first-choice** runtime for pool agents in frozen mode. Do not re-introduce a `PYTHON_HOME`/PATH preference ABOVE the carried path, and do not relax the build preflight (it is the only thing guaranteeing the shipped python actually has the deps). Source mode is unchanged (uses `sys.executable`). **This change only takes effect after a fresh `python build.py` + reinstall** — the carried `python/` cannot be hot-copied into an existing frozen install (it must come from `pkg.zip`). Coverage: `agent/test_build_scripts.py::CarriedPythonContractTests` (7 tests).

### 2026-06-05 — Exec Report can no longer bleed into the answer body (boundary sentinel + split-render)

**Symptom (user-reported):** the per-agent Execution Report tables appended at the tail of a Multi-Turn answer were getting *embedded into the answer's own HTML tables* — a visual mess where "what ran" merged into the response.

**Root cause:** the answer prose and the appended exec-report HTML were concatenated into ONE string and rendered in a SINGLE `innerHTML` parse (`agent_page_chat.js::buildAutomatedMessageElement`). When the LLM answer contained an HTML table (prompt.pmt rule 6) that wasn't perfectly closed, the browser's HTML parser **foster-parented** the trailing exec `<table>`s into/around it. A wrapper `<div class="exec-report-frame">` alone (added the prior session) **cannot** prevent this — it is the same parse — and that prior CSS had also never reached the served `staticfiles/` (DEBUG serves live from `agent/static/`, so the real gap was the un-restarted server + the structural parse issue, not the CSS).

**Fix (the contract — do NOT revert):**
- `agent/services/response_parser.py` defines `EXEC_REPORT_BOUNDARY = "<!--TLAMATINI_EXEC_REPORT_BOUNDARY-->"`. `process_llm_response` now builds the system-appended section (exec-report tables + Ask-Execs denial banner) separately and joins it onto the answer with this sentinel — **only when non-empty** (a plain answer is never followed by a stray marker). It is persisted into the saved `AgentMessage` verbatim, so reload re-isolates identically.
- `agent/static/agent/js/agent_page_chat.js` declares the byte-identical `const EXEC_REPORT_BOUNDARY` and, in `buildAutomatedMessageElement`, splits the message on it and parses **each half in its OWN `innerHTML`** (prose → `.automated-message-body`, system section → `.automated-message-execreport`). Two independent DOM subtrees = a malformed/unclosed answer table can NEVER absorb the exec tables. This is the structural guarantee; the `.exec-report-frame` markup/CSS is now belt-and-suspenders, not the load-bearing part.
- **Keep the two `EXEC_REPORT_BOUNDARY` constants byte-for-byte in sync.** It is an HTML comment so an old/cached frontend degrades gracefully (marker renders invisibly, falls back to the legacy single concatenated parse).
- Untouched: `_render_exec_report_html` output (still emits `.exec-report-frame`/`.exec-report-block`/per-agent captions), the executor capture path, and the `exec_report_enabled` gating — so `ExecReportCaptureTests` / `ExecReportPersistenceTests` / `AskExecsDenialBannerTests` stay green (they assert on captions/`exec-report-block`/`row.message == final`, none of which the boundary changes). **Requires a Django server restart** to emit the new markup (and a browser hard-refresh; `STATIC_VERSION` cache-busts JS/CSS on each restart).

### 2026-06-04 — AudioPlayer (#73) + VideoPlayer (#74): the media-PLAYBACK pair that completes the media-I/O family

The media-I/O family is now **screen / camera-in / mic-in / speakers-out / screen-out**: Shoter (screen), Camcorder (camera capture), Recorder (mic capture), **AudioPlayer** (audio file → speakers), **VideoPlayer** (video file → a display, with audio). Both new agents ship on the canvas AND as wrapped Multi-Turn tools (`chat_agent_audioplayer` / `chat_agent_videoplayer`). Contracts to keep:

- **Historical capture note, superseded 2026-06-07:** both are observational/output and mutate no persistent state, but their wrapped Multi-Turn calls ARE now captured automatically like every `chat_agent_*`. They still need no curated `_EXEC_REPORT_TOOLS` entry because that map is only an optional styling/merge refinement. AudioPlayer does not change the OS default endpoint and VideoPlayer does not change the OS default monitor.
- **`time_played` truncate/loop is a STREAMING contract, not a prebuilt buffer.** AudioPlayer uses a `sounddevice` `OutputStream` wrap-around callback; VideoPlayer uses a wall-clock `drive_playback` loop that re-seeks the backend on EOF. `0` = whole file once; `N>0` = exactly N s, truncating a longer file or looping a shorter one (whole repeats + a final partial). Do NOT "simplify" either into `np.tile(...)` then play — a large `time_played` over a tiny file would allocate gigabytes.
- **Sampling rate / backend nuances:** AudioPlayer plays at the FILE's native rate by default (`sample_rate: 0`, read from the file — correct pitch); a non-zero value forces the output rate and pitch-shifts (not resampled). VideoPlayer's audio+video is **`ffpyplayer`** (pip wheel bundles ffmpeg+SDL → no external ffmpeg, no runtime download) with **OpenCV** (`cv2`) for the window; if ffpyplayer is unavailable it degrades to **silent cv2 video** — keep that fallback (it is the reason the core honors "bundles with no problems" even worst-case). `build.py` carries `--collect-all ffpyplayer` AND `ffpyplayer` in `_agent_libs`; do NOT drop either (PyInstaller's module graph alone misses ffpyplayer's bundled DLLs).
- **Top-level promotion + parametrizer fields.** `tools._PROMOTE_SECTION_FIELDS_BY_TEMPLATE_DIR` promotes `input_path` (and friends) for both so the LLM sees the played path without grepping the log; `agent_contracts._PARAMETRIZER_OUTPUT_FIELDS` + `parametrizer.SECTION_AGENT_TYPES` list `audioplayer` / `videoplayer`. Migrations `0116`/`0117` (AudioPlayer) and `0118`/`0119` (VideoPlayer); deps `soundfile` and `ffpyplayer` in `requirements.txt`. Full per-agent notes live in `docs/claude/agents.md`; coverage = `test_audioplayer_agent.py` (43) + `test_videoplayer_agent.py` (38).

### 2026-06-04 — TeleTlamatini + WhatsTlamatini adapted to the post-"Ask Execs" world (ungated by design + WhatsTlamatini ACPX parity)

Historical note: WhatsTlamatini was retired later; current WhatsApp send/receive belongs to Whatsapper on the official Meta Cloud API.

Both long-running chat-bridge bots were swept against every change since "Ask Execs" (2026-05-29). The user's explicit decision: the bots stay **fully authorized / ungated** — a Telegram/WhatsApp operator cannot answer a browser Proceed/Deny modal, and prompting over chat "would be a headache." Keep these contracts; do NOT revert them:

- **`ask_execs_enabled` is HARD-PINNED `False` in the outbound chat payload** of BOTH bots (`teletlamatini.py` / `whatstlamatini.py` → `_send_and_collect.send_payload`). It is sent explicitly (not omitted) so a future change to the consumer's server-side default can never silently re-gate the bot. If Ask Execs were ever on for a bot, the executor thread would BLOCK on a browser modal nobody can answer until `total_timeout`, then return empty. **Do NOT remove the pin or "wire up" Telegram/WhatsApp approval** — it was considered and explicitly declined.
- **Classifier explicitly skips the Ask-Execs UI-control frames.** `'exec-permission-request'` / `'exec-permission-response'` were added to `_SPECIAL_TYPES_TO_SKIP` in both bots. The consumer broadcasts `exec-permission-request` to the whole per-user room group (`chat_user_<id>`), so if a human browser is logged into the SAME Tlamatini account and ticks Ask Execs, that frame lands on the bot's socket — the explicit skip guarantees it is never mistaken for a partial/final answer.
- **Run each bot on a DEDICATED Tlamatini account** (documented in both `config.yaml`s). The WS room group, request global-state (`last_exec_report_*`, now also `last_exec_report_denied`), AND the per-user Ask-Execs broker are all keyed by Tlamatini user id (`consumers.connect`, `exec_permission.py`), so sharing the account with a browser human cross-talks. This is documentation/deploy guidance, not a code gate.
- **WhatsTlamatini gained full ACPX parity** (it previously carried NO `acpx_enabled` at all — TeleTlamatini had it since 2026-05-08): `acpx_enabled` now flows through `TlamatiniBridge.__init__` → `send_payload` → `_resolve_tlamatini_cfg` → bridge construction → ready log + the dynamic `_format_auth_ok(...)` auth message; `config.yaml` sets `acpx_enabled: true`. Both resolvers also warn (non-fatal) when `acpx_enabled and not multi_turn_enabled` (ACPX needs the Multi-Turn planner to bind the `acp_*` tools).
- Coverage: `agent/test_chat_bridge_bots.py` (9 `SimpleTestCase` tests, loads both pool modules via `importlib` with cwd save/restore like `test_kalier_agent.py`) — pins the skip-set, the FINAL-frame detection, ACPX resolution, the end-to-end payload (`ask_execs_enabled: False` + `acpx_enabled`), and the shipped configs. ruff clean. **Frozen needs `python build.py`** to ship the edited agents; no migration (no DB/display-name change). Pure agent + config + docs change; no server-side edits.

### 2026-06-03 — Recorder agent (#72): microphone → WAV, the observational AUDIO sibling of Camcorder/Shoter

New workflow agent **Recorder** (`agent/agents/recorder/`) — microphone / audio-input capture via `sounddevice`, saved as a WAV (stdlib `wave`), on BOTH the canvas and Multi-Turn (`chat_agent_recorder`). It is the SOUND peer of the capture trio (Shoter = screen, Camcorder = camera, Recorder = audio) and, like both, is **observational → deliberately NOT in `_EXEC_REPORT_TOOLS`** (it records, it doesn't mutate state). Things to keep aligned / not revert:

- **Defaults that matter:** `device_index` defaults to `-1` = the system DEFAULT input device (the agent logs the numbered PortAudio input-device list at startup so a caller can read the right index; `device_name` is a case-insensitive name-substring fallback, only consulted when `device_index` is `-1`). `sample_rate` defaults to `0` = the device's NATIVE default rate on purpose — forcing a rate the driver does not support raises a PortAudio error, so the safe default lets the device choose and the rate actually used is read back + logged + put in the INI block. `channels` defaults to mono (`1`) and is clamped down to the device's reported max so an over-request can never crash the capture. Do not "default" `sample_rate`/`device_index` to fixed values.
- **`input_gain_percent` is POST-capture digital scaling, not the hardware mic level** (`100` = unity/byte-identical, `200` = +6 dB, `50` = −6 dB, `0` = silence). It amplifies the noise floor and a hot signal CLIPS, so the count of samples hitting the int16 rail is logged and surfaced as `clipped_samples` in `INI_SECTION_RECORDER` for a downstream Forker.
- **Output location:** the Music known-folder (`~/Music`, localized e.g. "Música") under `TlamatiniRecords`, collision-proof timestamped filename. (Recordings are user deliverables, not scratch — so NOT under `<app>/Temp`; consistent with the 2026-06-02 policy, which governs *transient* files.)
- **Robust numeric coercion:** the agent uses `_coerce_int`/`_coerce_float` helpers so a YAML/string config value (`"5"`, `"48000"`) never crashes the capture, and it promotes the saved `output_path` into the INI header.
- **Wiring (mirrors Camcorder/Shoter):** `update_recorder_connection_view` (views.py, target-only producer) + urls.py route; migrations **0114** (Agent row) / **0115** (Tool row); `ChatWrappedAgentSpec` in `chat_agent_registry.py`; `_PARAMETRIZER_OUTPUT_FIELDS['recorder']` in `services/agent_contracts.py`; `'recorder'` in `parametrizer.py` `SECTION_AGENT_TYPES`; `sounddevice` in `requirements.txt`. Frontend: unique CSS gradient, the FULL connection set in `acp-canvas-core.js` (classMap + mouseup + `removeConnection` + `removeConnectionsFor`), undo/redo in `acp-canvas-undo.js`, `.flw` load in `acp-file-io.js`, `updateRecorderConnection` connector, `_mapToolArgsToAgentConfig` branch in `agent_page_chat.js`, eslint global + 3 `/* global */` headers.
- Emits an atomic `INI_SECTION_RECORDER` block (`output_path`/`output_dir`/`filename`/`device_index`/`device_name`/`sample_rate`/`channels`/`duration_seconds`/`gain_percent`/`clipped_samples`/`format`/`response_body`) and ALWAYS triggers `target_agents`. 30 tests; E2E-verified against a real microphone + the wrapped tool. **Frozen needs `python build.py`** (bundles `sounddevice` + the agent dir) and a `migrate`. Memory: `project_recorder_agent`.

### 2026-06-03 — Camcorder agent (#71): webcam photo/video, the observational sibling of Shoter

New workflow agent **Camcorder** (`agent/agents/camcorder/`) — physical-camera capture via OpenCV (`cv2`), on BOTH the canvas and Multi-Turn (`chat_agent_camcorder`). It is the hardware-camera peer of Shoter (Shoter = screen, Camcorder = camera) and, like Shoter, is **observational → deliberately NOT in `_EXEC_REPORT_TOOLS`** (it records, it doesn't mutate state). Things to keep aligned / not revert:

- **Defaults that matter:** `capture_mode` defaults to `photo` (ONE shot, `.jpg`); `video` records `video_duration_seconds` (no audio, `.mp4`/`mp4v`). `resolution_width`/`resolution_height` default to `0×0` = the camera's NATIVE mode on purpose — webcams only support discrete modes, so forcing an unsupported one snaps to the nearest; when a `W×H` is requested the **read-back applied** value is logged. Do not "default" these to a fixed resolution.
- **Output location:** the Pictures known-folder (`SHGetKnownFolderPath` FOLDERID_Pictures via `ctypes`, fallback `~/Pictures`) under `TlamatiniCamcorder`, collision-proof timestamped filename. (Captured media are user deliverables, not scratch — so this is NOT under `<app>/Temp`; that's intentional and consistent with the 2026-06-02 policy, which governs *transient* files.)
- **Wiring (mirrors Shoter, plus the bits Shoter lacks):** `update_camcorder_connection_view` (views.py, target-only producer) + urls.py route; migrations **0112** (Agent row) / **0113** (Tool row); `ChatWrappedAgentSpec` in `chat_agent_registry.py`; `_PARAMETRIZER_OUTPUT_FIELDS['camcorder']` in `services/agent_contracts.py`; `'camcorder'` in `parametrizer.py` `SECTION_AGENT_TYPES`; `opencv-python==4.13.0.92` in `requirements.txt`. Frontend: unique CSS gradient (charcoal→REC-red→amber→gold), and the FULL connection set in `acp-canvas-core.js` (classMap + mouseup + `removeConnection` + `removeConnectionsFor` — more complete than Shoter, which is missing the remove paths), undo/redo in `acp-canvas-undo.js`, `.flw` load in `acp-file-io.js`, `updateCamcorderConnection` connector, `_mapToolArgsToAgentConfig` branch in `agent_page_chat.js`, eslint global + 3 `/* global */` headers.
- Emits an atomic `INI_SECTION_CAMCORDER` block (`output_path`/`output_dir`/`filename`/`media_type`/`camera_index`/`duration_seconds`/`resolution`/`fps`/`response_body`) and ALWAYS triggers `target_agents`. 22 tests; E2E-verified against a real camera. **Frozen needs `python build.py`** (bundles OpenCV + the agent dir) and a `migrate`. Memory: `project_camcorder_agent`.

### 2026-06-02 — Temp + Templates directory policy (all transient files stay INSIDE Tlamatini)

Two application-root directories now own every non-source file Tlamatini writes. **Do NOT revert** the resolution/enforcement or the LLM indications:

- **`<app>/Temp`** — the SOLE temp dir (frozen: next to `Tlamatini.exe`; source: the repo root). Resolver `agent/path_guard.py`: `get_app_temp_root()` / `enforce_app_temp_dir()` (pins `TMP`/`TEMP`/`TMPDIR` + `tempfile.tempdir`, exports `TLAMATINI_TEMP`) / `is_within_app_temp` / `resolve_temp_path`. `manage.py::_enforce_app_temp_dir()` runs it **before Django**; `tlamatini/settings.py::_pin_temp_directory()` repeats it (covers a direct `daphne`/`asgi` launch). Pool agents inherit it via `get_agent_env`'s `os.environ.copy()`, so a bare `tempfile.*` in ANY agent already lands under `<app>/Temp`. The temp-creating agents (executer, de_compresser, esp32er, stm32er, arduiner, plus historical TelegramRX templates in older installs) ALSO carry an explicit module-top **`if (os.environ.get('TLAMATINI_TEMP') or '').strip(): … tempfile.tempdir = …`** guard — it MUST stay an `if`-block, NOT a top-level `def` (a def before the imports trips ruff **E402**; mirror the conhost-guard shape).
- **`<app>/Templates`** — the DEFAULT parent for the project trees the firmware/engine agents (STM32er / ESP32er / Arduiner / Unrealer) scaffold, UNLESS the user names another path. `path_guard::get_app_templates_root` / `enforce_app_templates_dir` (exports `TLAMATINI_TEMPLATES`; does **not** touch TMP/tempfile — Templates holds deliverables, not scratch). STM32er `_build_arguments('create_project')` defaults a blank `dest_parent` → `TLAMATINI_TEMPLATES` (gated on the env var, so unit tests without it keep old behavior). ESP32er/Arduiner/Unrealer are instruction-driven (the LLM roots `project_dir`/`sketch_path` under Templates).
- **LLM indications**: `prompt.pmt` **Rule 15** (Temp) + **Rule 16** (Templates); adding Rule 16 pushed "Conflict resolution" to **Rule 17** and updated the one Prime-Directive cross-ref. Absolute paths are injected as `{temp_directory}` / `{templates_directory}` by `rag/config.py::_resolve_temp_directory_for_prompt` / `_resolve_templates_directory_for_prompt` at the single prompt-load site (same `.replace`-before-template-parse pattern as `{self_knowledge}`; brace-escaped, fail-open). The old `C:\Temp\hello.py` example in Rule 11 was REMOVED — it was teaching the bad habit. `Tlamatini.md` §7 documents both. The 4 firmware/engine agents' `chat_agent_registry` `purpose`+`example_request` were updated to default scaffold dirs to Templates.
- **build.py** ships `Temp` + `Templates` empty next to the `.exe` (added to `empty_dirs`); `.gitignore` ignores both. **Frozen needs `python build.py`** (manage.py/settings.py/prompt.pmt/config.py/the agents live in the PYZ).
- **Authoring contract** (propagated into the runbooks): a new agent/tool/skill that writes scratch MUST route it through `<app>/Temp` (resolve via `path_guard`, or read `TLAMATINI_TEMP`); a new firmware/engine agent that scaffolds projects defaults to `<app>/Templates`. Updated: the `create-new-agent` / `create-new-mcp` / `skill-creator` / `flow-making` / `tlamatini-new-acp-agent` SKILL.md packages + the two `@`-imported guides (`.agents/workflows/create_new_agent.md`, `.mcps/create_new_mcp.md`).
- Tests: `agent/test_temp_dir_policy.py` (33 — real resolution/enforcement, executes each agent's actual block, real `prompt.pmt` injection, static wiring). The run also surfaced + FIXED 3 PRE-EXISTING reds: `AssignmentParserRobustness` (rewrote the 3 firmware `example_request`s single-step — the parser choked on the `"; then action="` narrative), `PreLaunchScriptPreview` (registered esp32er/arduiner in `_PRE_LAUNCH_PREVIEW_BY_TEMPLATE`), `AgentDescriptionsCoverage` (the agent-folder scan now skips dot-dirs like `.ruff_cache`). Memory: `project_temp_templates_policy`.

### 2026-06-01 — `flow-making` skill (objective → `.flw`) + two contracts that make catalog skill-prompts work

New in-process skill `agent/skills_pkg/flow_making/` wraps the FlowCreator engine to produce a canvas-loadable `.flw` from a prompt. Two non-obvious contracts — **do NOT "simplify" them away**:

1. **`execute_command` runs with NO `cwd`** (`agent/tools.py` — `subprocess.run(command, shell=True)`), so it inherits the chat process's working directory = the **Django project root** (where `manage.py` lives), NOT the repo root. Therefore the skill runbook invokes its scripts as `python agent/skills_pkg/flow_making/scripts/make_flow.py …` — **without** the `Tlamatini/` prefix. The `Tlamatini/agent/…` form is only correct for human-run repo-root commands (e.g. the lint command). If you "fix" the SKILL.md to add `Tlamatini/`, the runtime call breaks with "can't open file".
2. **Catalog skill-prompts MUST literally name `invoke_skill` / `list_skills`.** `list_skills` / `invoke_skill` are ACPX-surface tools (`agent.acpx.ACPX_TOOL_NAMES`) — `filter_acpx_tools()` strips them whenever the **ACPX** toggle is off, and the planner never sees them. The Catalog auto-sets the toolbar toggles from prompt text via `tools_dialog.js::classifyPromptModes`, which tags a prompt **ACPX** (⇒ also Multi-Turn) ONLY when it contains a literal `invoke_skill`/`list_skills`/`acp_*` token (after the "do NOT use …" scrub). So **`idPrompt=69` ALARM FLOW FORGE** (migration `0108`) is phrased around `invoke_skill('flow-making', …)` on purpose — a bare natural "create a flow file …" would classify One-Shot, leave ACPX off, and the skill would be invisible. Same reasoning applies to any future catalog prompt that drives a skill.

The `.flw` the converter (`scripts/result_to_flw.py`) emits must stay the `schemaVersion: 2` `{nodes:[{id,text,left,top,agentPurpose,configData}], connections:[{sourceIndex,targetIndex,inputSlot,outputSlot,…}], artifacts}` shape that `acp-file-io.js::loadDiagram` consumes — node `text` lowercases back to the canvas classMap + the connection-restoration `switch`, and connections are keyed by **integer index**. It round-trips through `agent/services/flow_spec.py::normalize_flow_payload`. The legacy `tlamatini-flow-from-objective` skill's old `{version, agents, connections:[{from,to,kind}]}` shape was OBSOLETE (would not load) — it was rewritten to delegate to `flow-making`.


- **Taskbar attention notice — flash the `Tlamatini.exe` console window + UPPERCASE log banner on Ask-Execs prompts and Notifier notifications — 2026-05-31** — Successor to the removed Notifier-toast experiment (see 2026-05-30 below). The user asked for a "blinking taskbar icon when an app needs attention". **Hard constraint stated up front and honored**: page JavaScript is sandboxed and **cannot** flash its own *browser* taskbar button (same wall that killed the toast), and the backend can't reliably identify which browser window is Tlamatini's. So the *guaranteed* mechanism is to flash the **`Tlamatini.exe` window the Django process itself owns**. "Do NOT revert / keep aligned" contracts:
  1. **Backend = `agent/window_flash.py` (NEW).** `flash_console_window(count=5)` calls `FlashWindowEx(GetConsoleWindow(), FLASHW_ALL, count)` — the classic Win10/11 "needs attention" orange taskbar highlight (flashes N times, then stays highlighted until the window is activated). `build_attention_banner(page, reason)` returns a **fully UPPERCASE** multi-line banner (`assertEqual(banner, banner.upper())` is a test contract — the user explicitly wanted *mayúsculas*). `notify_attention(page, reason)` flashes **and** `print()`s the banner (tee'd to `tlamatini.log` process-wide by `manage.py`, so the notice survives even with no visible console). **Fail-safe: nothing here ever raises into the request path**; a windowless/headless launch degrades to the banner only and `flash_console_window` returns `False` (NOT an error).
  2. **Endpoint = `POST /agent/flash_window/`** (`views.flash_window_view`, wired via `secure_post` = `login_required`+`csrf_protect`+`require_POST` in `urls.py`). Body `{page, reason}`; tolerates a malformed body (falls back to a generic banner, still 200). It imports `notify_attention` locally so a missing helper can't break module import.
  3. **Frontend triggers (browser → endpoint).** `shared-runtime-dialogs.js` gained `flashTlamatiniWindow(reason, page)` (self-contained CSRF read from `document.cookie`; auto-detects the page from `window.location.pathname` → `agent_page.html` vs `agentic_control_panel.html`) exported on `window.SharedRuntimeDialogs`. It is called (a) **inside `renderNotifierToast()`** — the single shared renderer used by BOTH the chat poller (`chat_page_runtime_poller.js`) and the ACP (`acp-running-state.js`), so one hook covers both pages; this fires **once per notification** because the backend deletes `notification.json` after one read (`views.py` ~L3079); and (b) in `agent_page_chat.js`'s `exec-permission-request` handler (Ask-Execs), pinned to `page='agent_page.html'`. Best-effort: a fetch failure never breaks the dialog.
  4. **Why not the browser's own taskbar button**: impossible from page JS (sandbox). The browser side was deliberately scoped OUT (user chose ".exe window only + log banner"); the title/favicon-blink alternative was not built. Frozen `C:\Tlamatini` ships `window_flash.py`/`views.py`/`urls.py` **inside the PYZ** → needs `python build.py` to take effect (the JS can be hot-deployed to `_internal/staticfiles` if desired). Tests: `FlashWindowAttentionTests` (8, drives the real view + helper; Win32 flash degrades to `False` in the headless test process). Memory: `project_taskbar_flash_attention`.

- **`execute_file` foreground window was a FALSE-OK in the Daphne worker → now `CREATE_NEW_CONSOLE` + real on-screen verification — 2026-05-30** — Follow-on to the 2026-05-29 `execute_file` fix below (which made the foreground path *reachable* via `force_foreground`; this makes it *actually open a visible window* and *report the truth*). Diagnosed from the live `tlamatini.log` at `C:\Tlamatini`, not theory: the user asked to "run cat_art.py in a foreground/forked window", `execute_file` was called with `foreground=true`, and it **returned** `"Launched … in a foreground terminal window — the script opened and ran visibly on your desktop"` while **nothing appeared** (the Windower step then had no `cat_art` window to close). Production change is **`agent/tools.py` ONLY**. "Do NOT revert / keep aligned" contracts:
  1. **Root cause = the launch mechanism, not the gating.** `launch_in_new_terminal`'s foreground branch did `subprocess.Popen('start "Tlamatini Console" cmd /k python …', shell=True)`. The outer `cmd /c` that runs the `start` builtin exits 0 instantly, so Popen "succeeds" — but whether a console window actually appears depends on the spawning process having a usable console / window-station. The Multi-Turn executor runs in a **Daphne thread-pool worker with no console**, so the window silently never showed. `start` via `shell=True` also fires cmd **AutoRun** (e.g. `doskey` macros), which overwrote the window **title** — breaking title-based close by Windower/Keyboarder (live-probe-confirmed: title came out `'Tlamatini Console - doskey  npm=pnpm $*'`, no script name).
  2. **Fix = `CREATE_NEW_CONSOLE` + forced `SW_SHOWNORMAL`.** Windows foreground path now spawns `cmd.exe /k title Tlamatini Console - <script> & <python> <args>` with `creationflags=CREATE_NEW_CONSOLE` and a `STARTUPINFO` whose `dwFlags|=STARTF_USESHOWWINDOW`, `wShowWindow=1`. This is the documented mechanism that *forces* a brand-new on-screen console for the child **regardless of the parent's console state** — the same flag the visible wrapped-agent path (`_start_template_agent_process`) already uses. No `shell=True`, so **no AutoRun title pollution**. `title …` stamps the **script basename into the window title** so Windower/Keyboarder can find and close the exact window. Non-Windows keeps the legacy `start … shell=True` string (unreachable in practice; foreground-console is Windows-centric).
  3. **No more FALSE-OK — `execute_file` now VERIFIES.** New `_verify_foreground_window(script_path, timeout=2.5)` polls `EnumWindows` for a visible top-level window whose title contains the script basename; returns `True` (confirmed on screen) / `False` (Windows, none within timeout → caller must NOT claim success) / `None` (non-Windows or enumeration error → stay neutral). Fail-open, never raises. `execute_file`'s foreground branch reports accordingly: `True`→"CONFIRMED a visible window … is now open"; `False`→"a visible window … did NOT appear … DO NOT report this as success … investigate"; `None`→"could not be auto-verified on this host". The old code blindly returned success on `window_opened = foreground or not _suppress…` with **zero** on-screen check — that assumption WAS the false-OK.
  4. **Proven LIVE against the real code** (not just unit tests, per the standing "tests give false confidence" rule): drove the real `agent.tools.execute_file.func(SCRIPT, foreground=True)` through a real `django.setup()` with `suppress_visible_consoles=True` (the exact Multi-Turn condition) → a window titled `Tlamatini Console - cat_art.py - …"C:\Tlamatini\applications\cat_art.py"` appeared (independent `EnumWindows` confirmation) and the result string said CONFIRMED. Tests: `MultiTurnBackgroundLaunchTests` — `test_launch_in_new_terminal_opens_visible_new_console_when_not_suppressed` (now asserts `CREATE_NEW_CONSOLE`+`wShowWindow=1`+title carries script name, NOT `start … shell=True`) and three `test_execute_file_foreground_*` (confirms/failure/neutral wording). Frozen `C:\Tlamatini` runs `tools.py` **compiled into the PYZ inside `Tlamatini.exe`** (no loose `.pyc` to hot-patch — `_internal/agent/` is data only), so this needs a `python build.py` to ship. Memory: `project_execute_file_foreground_fix`.

- **Notifier "toast"/desktop-popup experiment REMOVED; Windows "Installed apps" registration KEPT — 2026-05-30** — The Notifier's experimental **second surface (a native Windows toast, later a self-drawn desktop popup) never worked reliably and has been removed entirely** at the user's request. For an *unpackaged* app the Windows notification platform silently drops the WinRT/OS banner under Focus Assist / Do-Not-Disturb / throttling even when `ToastNotifier.Show()` succeeds, and the self-drawn-window fallback was abandoned too. **Do NOT re-introduce a desktop/toast notification surface for the Notifier** — it burned a lot of effort for no working result. The Notifier is back to its single, reliable surface: it drops `notification.json` and the chat UI renders an in-page popup (+ optional `.wav`).
  - **DELETED**: `agent/native_toast.py`, `agent/test_native_toast.py`, `agent/agents/notifier/toast_popup.py`, `agent/agents/notifier/test_toast_popup.py`, `static/agent/img/Tlamatini.png`, the `apps.py` icon-export / `native_toast.register_all()` blocks, the `build.py` `Tlamatini.png` copy, and every toast config key (`native_toast` / `toast_title` / `toast_image` / `toast_seconds` / `toast_click`). `agent/agents/notifier/notifier.py` and `config.yaml` were restored to their pre-toast state. (`manage.py`'s `SetCurrentProcessExplicitAppUserModelID` AUMID stays — that is **taskbar** identity, never part of the toast.)
  - **KEPT — separate, independent feature: Windows "Installed apps" entry** (user asked Tlamatini show up in Settings ▸ Apps ▸ Installed apps / Control Panel): `agent/windows_app_registration.py` writes the per-user (HKCU) ARP key `…\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\Tlamatini` (Uninstall→`Uninstaller.exe`). `install.py::_register_programs_entry` writes it, `uninstall.py::_unregister_programs_entry` deletes it, `apps.py` self-heals it on every **frozen** launch (HKCU / non-admin). This was NEVER part of the toast — keep it. Tests: `agent/test_windows_app_registration.py`.

- **Pythonxer: STRICT correctness gate + ALWAYS-trigger-downstream + Multi-Turn fix→re-ruff→retry loop — 2026-05-29** — Two behaviour changes to `agent/agents/pythonxer/pythonxer.py` + `config.yaml` (and a one-line generic change in `agent/tools.py`). "Do NOT revert / keep aligned" contracts:
  1. **Strict gate before any execution.** `execute_python_script` now (a) `compile(script, path, "exec")` — a script that does not even parse is REFUSED (logged with line/col/snippet, never run, returns non-zero); then (b) `ruff_ok = validate_with_ruff(...)`, and when `_RUFF_BLOCKING` (read from config `ruff_blocking`, **default true**) and Ruff found real lint/static errors → logs `⛔ RUFF FAILED - refusing to execute` + the `[Ruff]` findings and returns non-zero, **without executing**. Ruff being absent or timing out **fails open** (advisory) — the `compile()` syntax floor still runs. Before this, `validate_with_ruff` was called with its return value discarded ("non-blocking") so a wrong script ran anyway. Set `ruff_blocking: false` in the node config to restore advisory behaviour (findings logged, script still runs).
  2. **ALWAYS triggers `target_agents` — no matter what.** The old `if script_result:` guard around the downstream-trigger loop in `main()` is **removed**. Pythonxer now starts its downstream/output agents on success, on a gate refusal, AND on a runtime failure — it never dead-ends a flow. The exit code (0 success / 1 any failure) is unchanged and still drives the LED and the Multi-Turn retry loop, but **NO LONGER gates whether downstream starts**. This intentionally **drops the documented "exit-code gates downstream" Pythonxer primitive** per the user's emphatic request — downstream agents do any result-checking the user wires (a Forker/Raiser on a marker the script printed). Errors are ALWAYS logged. The `agentic_skill.md`, `agents_descriptions.md`, `agents.md`, `KIMI.md`, and `BookOfTlamatini.md` Pythonxer entries were updated to match so FlowCreator does not design flows assuming downstream is skipped on failure.
  3. **End-to-end LLM retry loop (`agent/tools.py::_launch_wrapped_chat_agent`, generic to all wrapped agents).** A failed wrapped run now returns `retryable=True` and a message instructing the LLM to read `log_excerpt` (SyntaxError / "RUFF FAILED" + `[Ruff]` findings / traceback), REWRITE the script in full, call the SAME tool again, and repeat fix→re-run→re-check until it passes — never re-sending an identical script. The loop closes because `chat_agent_runtime.reconcile_chat_agent_run` maps Pythonxer's non-zero exit → `status="failed"` + forwards the log tail (now carrying the gate banner), and the Multi-Turn repetition breaker blocks identical re-sends so only a CORRECTED script proceeds. Was `retryable=False` ("inspect the log" → give up).
  4. **Ruff guaranteed present in BOTH frozen and source modes (`build.py` + `requirements.txt`).** `ruff==0.14.5` is pinned (with a do-not-remove comment) and `build.py` now runs the EXACT runtime invocation — `[target_python, "-m", "ruff", "--version"]` — for BOTH the build Python AND the PYTHON_HOME (frozen-agent) Python after the agent-libs verify, and `sys.exit(1)` (aborts the build) if it fails. A green build therefore guarantees the strict gate has Ruff at runtime. Frozen `C:\Tlamatini` needs a `python build.py` to pick up the pythonxer/tools changes. Verified hermetically (real `pythonxer.py` as a subprocess, all four outcomes); decisive proof is a live Multi-Turn run. Memory: `project_pythonxer_strict_ruff_gate`.

- **`execute_file` foreground/background is USER-DRIVEN + a `.py` parse-gate (no more headless-but-reported-OK) — 2026-05-29** — Real, evidence-backed fix (diagnosed from `tlamatini.log`, not theory) for "asked for a foreground window, none opened, Tlamatini reported success". Production change is **`agent/tools.py` ONLY**, two functions. "Do NOT revert / keep aligned" contracts:
  1. **Root cause:** Multi-Turn wraps every request in `scoped_request_state(..., suppress_visible_consoles=multi_turn_enabled)` (`mcp_agent.py`), so `_suppress_visible_console_launches()` returned True and `launch_in_new_terminal` always took the `_launch_python_in_background` branch (`CREATE_NO_WINDOW | DETACHED_PROCESS`, stdio→DEVNULL) — the `start … cmd /k` foreground path was never reached. The user's "foreground window" ran headless and `execute_file` returned `"executed successfully in a new terminal window"` unconditionally (no exit-code check; fire-and-forget into DEVNULL).
  2. **Fix:** `launch_in_new_terminal(script, args, force_foreground=False)` — suppression is now bypassed when `force_foreground=True` (`if _suppress_visible_console_launches() and not force_foreground:`). `execute_file(command, foreground=False)` passes `force_foreground=foreground`. **The foreground/background choice is the USER'S** (per the user's explicit rule): the docstring instructs the LLM to set `foreground=True` ONLY when the user explicitly asks for a visible/foreground/forked window — **if the user says nothing, leave it False and the script runs in the BACKGROUND with no window.** A window opens iff `foreground=True` OR suppression is off (legacy non-Multi-Turn). Do NOT make foreground the default.
  3. **Parse-gate + honest result:** before launching, if the resolved file ends `.py`/`.pyw`, `compile()`-check it; on `SyntaxError` return an actionable `Error:` (line+col+snippet, "rewrite IN FULL with file_creator") and do NOT launch. Fails open on NUL/unreadable. The result string now says "Launched … (confirms the launch, not that the script ran to completion)" — never "executed successfully". `execute_command`'s analogous `start …` false-OK was intentionally NOT touched (out of scope). Frozen `C:\Tlamatini` needs `python build.py`. Memory: `project_execute_file_foreground_fix`.


- **"Ask Execs" — runtime relax: uncheck mid-run to stop the prompts for the rest of that run — 2026-05-29** — Follow-up to the Ask-Execs feature below. The submit-time flag decides whether a broker is **registered** for a run; it can't be un-captured. But the user can now relax (or re-arm) an already-registered broker **mid-flight** by toggling the **Ask Execs** checkbox while a Multi-Turn run executes. "Do NOT revert / keep aligned" contracts:
  1. **Broker capability = `ExecPermissionBroker.set_auto_proceed(enabled)` + the `set_broker_auto_proceed(key, auto_proceed)` registry helper** (`agent/exec_permission.py`). `set_auto_proceed(True)` (a) short-circuits every **future** `request_permission` to `"proceed"` (under the lock, before the pending dict is touched — no frame emitted) and (b) resolves any **currently-blocking** prompt to `"proceed"` (mirrors `close()`, which resolves pending to `"deny"`). It is a **no-op after `close()`** — a torn-down request must never spring back to life. Do NOT make the future-call short-circuit emit a frame (the whole point is to stop prompting), and do NOT move the `_auto_proceed` check below the `self._pending[request_id] = pending` line (it must return before registering a pending slot).
  2. **Frame = `set-ask-execs-runtime`** (`{message, type, ask_execs_runtime_enabled}`). `consumers.receive` routes it to `set_broker_auto_proceed(user.id, auto_proceed=not enabled)` (unchecked→relax, re-checked→re-arm). Returns `applied=False` (harmless) when no broker is registered. **The frame MUST carry `message`** — `consumers.receive` reads `text_data_json['message']` unconditionally (same KeyError trap as the `exec-permission-response` frames).
  3. **Frontend sends it only while `inLongOperation === true`** (`agent_page_init.js` checkbox `change` handler). The toolbar toggle checkboxes are deliberately NOT disabled by `disableControlsDuringOperation()` (it only greys the chat input + context/canvas/menu buttons), so the box stays clickable during a run — do NOT add the toggles to that disable list or the feature dies. When relaxing, the handler also calls `dismissExecPermissionDialogForRuntimeProceed()` (`agent_page_dialogs.js`) to silently close any open prompt — it sets `_execPermDecisionSent = true` first so the dialog's close handler does NOT fire a stale `deny` (which would otherwise race the server-side `proceed` and halt the chain). New global registered in `eslint.config.mjs`.
  4. **Direction asymmetry is by design, not a bug.** Relaxing a run that **started** with Ask Execs **on** works (a broker exists). Turning Ask Execs **on** mid-run for a run that started with it **off** does nothing that run (no broker was ever registered) — it takes effect on the next submit. Coverage: 5 new `ExecPermissionBrokerTests` (`test_auto_proceed_*` + `test_set_broker_auto_proceed_helper_*`); ruff + ESLint clean (0 errors); all runtime-read, no `build.py` change.

- **"Ask Execs" — per-tool Proceed/Deny permission prompt before every Multi-Turn execution — 2026-05-29** — New toolbar checkbox **"Ask Execs"** (between **ACPX** and **Add internet context**) that, when on, makes the Multi-Turn executor BLOCK on a browser dialog before each state-changing Tool/MCP/Agent runs; **Deny halts the whole chain** and the answer gets a big red "Execution interrupted" banner (always) plus the Exec-report tables (when Exec report is also on). It is a **Multi-Turn-only modifier**: the checkbox is disabled+greyed unless Multi-Turn is checked, and every backend read gates it on `multi_turn_enabled` (mirrors the Exec-report gating). When unchecked, behaviour is byte-for-byte the legacy Multi-Turn flow. Architecture + "do NOT revert" contracts:
  1. **Backend↔browser bridge = `agent/exec_permission.py` (`ExecPermissionBroker` + a user-id-keyed registry).** The tool executor runs in a worker thread (`sync_to_async(ask_rag, thread_sensitive=False)`); it cannot `await`. So `request_permission(detail)` emits an `exec_permission_request` frame (scheduled onto the consumer's loop via `asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe`) and BLOCKS on a `threading.Event`. The browser's `exec-permission-response` frame routes through `consumers.receive` → `resolve_permission(user_id, request_id, decision)` → sets the event. **Fail-safe contract**: emit failure / broker `close()` / a mid-flight Cancel all resolve to **`deny`** (never run an unconfirmed tool); the **only** fail-OPEN case is "no broker registered" (unit tests / detached browser), which the consumer never hits because `queue_llm_retrieval` registers a broker whenever `ask_execs_enabled` and unregisters it in a `finally`. Do NOT make the missing-broker case deny (denying every call when no broker is present would break otherwise-valid requests), and do NOT make emit-failure proceed (that would run an unconfirmed tool).
  2. **The flag is threaded through the SAME whitelist that once dropped `exec_report_enabled`.** `UnifiedAgentChain.invoke`'s payload-rebuild dict MUST keep `ask_execs_enabled` **and** `conversation_user_id` (the executor finds its broker by user id). The executor sub-payload of BOTH `UnifiedAgentChain` and `UnifiedAgentRAGChain` forwards `ask_execs_enabled` + `ask_execs_user_id=conversation_user_id`. Removing any of these silently disables the prompt (same bug class as the Exec-report regression). `CapabilityAwareToolAgentExecutor.invoke` re-gates `ask_execs_enabled and multi_turn_enabled` and only adds the keys to `executor_payload` on the multi-turn path.
  3. **Gate placement = AFTER dedup + quota, right before `tool.invoke`.** In `MultiTurnToolAgentExecutor.invoke`'s per-tool loop the gate runs only for calls that will actually execute (skipped dedup/quota calls never prompt). `_requires_exec_permission` exempts `_MANAGEMENT_TOOLS` ∪ `_TOOL_QUOTA_EXEMPT` (status/log/time/window_present are inspection, not "executions"). On Deny it records `self._exec_denied` and returns immediately (no further tools, this or later turns). The denied tool itself is NOT added to `exec_report_entries` (it never ran) — only the **already-executed** tools are.
  4. **Denial propagation + banner ordering.** `exec_report_denied` flows executor `_build_result_dict` → both chains' `result_dict` (independent of `exec_report_enabled`) → `interface.ask_rag` stores `last_exec_report_denied` in `global_state` → consumer reads+clears it → `services/response_parser.process_llm_response(..., exec_report_denied=...)` appends `_render_exec_denied_banner(...)` **after** the Exec-report tables but **before** `save_message` (so a chat reload restores the banner; respects the existing strict ordering contract). The banner is NOT gated on the Exec-report toggle.
  Surfaces kept aligned (change together): `agent_page.html` (checkbox `#ask-execs-enabled` + `#exec-permission-dialog-message`); `agent_page_state.js` (`isAskExecsEnabled`/`persist`/`applyStored`/`syncAskExecsAvailability` — availability tied to Multi-Turn); `agent_page_init.js` (sends `ask_execs_enabled`, wires checkbox, re-syncs on Multi-Turn change); `agent_page_dialogs.js` (`showExecPermissionDialog` — modal Proceed[green]/Deny[red], titlebar-X hidden + Esc off, close==Deny, decision idempotent); `agent_page_chat.js` (`exec-permission-request` handler); `agent_page.css` (`.exec-denied-*` banner + `.exec-perm-*` dialog + `.toolbar-toggle-disabled`); `eslint.config.mjs` globals. **Both `exec-permission-response` JS frames MUST include a `message` key** — `consumers.receive` reads `text_data_json['message']` unconditionally before branching, so omitting it raises a KeyError that surfaces as the generic "cannot process your requests" error. Coverage: `ExecPermissionBrokerTests` (13 — incl. the 2026-05-29 runtime-relax auto-proceed tests) + `AskExecsExecutorGateTests` (5) + `AskExecsHelperTests` (4) + `AskExecsDenialBannerTests` (2) + `AskExecsChainPropagationTests` (1) in `agent/tests.py`; ruff + ESLint clean (0 errors). Source + frozen need no `build.py` change (all runtime-read). Pre-existing/unrelated full-suite failures (6): the two `MultiTurnBackgroundLaunchTests` capability-executor tests (stub `object()` lacks `bind_tools` on the pre-existing `if not acpx_enabled` branch), `ParametrizerSequentialExecutionTests`, `AcpxConfigSourceModeTests`, `AssignmentParserRobustnessTests`, and the documented `PromptValidationDecisionTests.test_seeded_prompts_use_deterministic_validation_only`.

- **STM32er agent — zero-config auto-bootstrap + fail-safe hardware preflight + the `Stm32Er`→`STM32er` casing fix — v1.9.0, 2026-05-26** — STM32er (agent #68; catalog now **68** / wrapped chat-agents now **43**; migrations `0101_add_stm32er` + `0102_add_chat_agent_stm32er_tool`, demo prompts `0103`) bridges the **STM32 Template Project MCP** (`https://github.com/XAIHT/STM32TemplateProjectMCP`, a FastMCP **stdio** server) on BOTH surfaces (canvas node + wrapped `chat_agent_stm32er`), driving it over a **self-contained inline MCP stdio JSON-RPC client** in `agent/agents/stm32er/stm32er.py` — stdlib-only, no `mcp` dep in the pool subprocess (Pitfall #10; same self-contained pattern as Kalier's `urllib` client), so it behaves identically in source and frozen builds. `action` selects the capability; the surface is **27 actions = the 23 MCP tools + 2 composites (`serial_session`, `live_monitor`) + 2 meta (`bootstrap`, `validate`)**. Three "do NOT revert" contracts:
  1. **ZERO-CONFIG AUTO-BOOTSTRAP (`_bootstrap_mcp`) — the default `stm32_mcp_server_script` is now `""` on purpose.** Empty + `auto_bootstrap: true` means STM32er **self-provisions** the MCP on first use: a shallow `git clone` of `mcp_repo_url`@`mcp_ref`, with a **GitHub-zip download fallback when git is absent on the host**, into `mcp_install_dir` (default `%LOCALAPPDATA%/Tlamatini/STM32TemplateProjectMCP`), then pip-installs `mcp` + `pyserial` if missing (`pip_install: true`) and validates the result. The whole point is that a user installs **only STM32CubeIDE + Tlamatini** — do NOT re-add a mandatory on-disk `server_script` default or remove the zip fallback. New `config.yaml` keys (must exist as placeholders or the wrapped-tool config writer silently drops the override): `auto_bootstrap`, `mcp_repo_url`, `mcp_ref`, `mcp_install_dir`, `auto_update`, `pip_install`. New global `config.json` defaults seeded by `tools._seed_global_agent_defaults`: `stm32_mcp_server_script` (now `""`), `stm32_mcp_repo_url`, `stm32_mcp_install_dir`.
  2. **SAFETY PREFLIGHT (`_preflight`, fail-safe) — REFUSE rather than mis-build/mis-flash.** Before any compile/flash, STM32er validates compiler / CubeIDE / make / programmer / ST-LINK driver + probe (`_probe_stlink`) / device family (`_device_family`) and **refuses with a clear reason** instead of producing a wrong artifact or flashing the wrong target. Gating: compile-only actions need NO connected board; hardware actions (`flash` / `erase` / `reset` / `serial_*` / SWD / `live_*`) require a connected ST-LINK; a cross-STM32F-family target is **refused** (the MCP template is **STM32F407VG-specific** — multi-family support is future work via an MCP fork, NOT a bug to "fix" by loosening the family check). New action `validate` runs the preflight standalone. New config: `preflight: true`, `device`. Do NOT weaken the family/board gates to "try anyway".
  3. **DISPLAY-NAME CASING is exactly `STM32er` (S,T,M,3,2,e,r).** A dev-DB row had been seeded as `Stm32Er`; it was corrected to `STM32er`. NEVER write `STM32Er` / `STM32ER` / `Stm32Er` / `Stm32er` as the **display** name (DB `agentDescription`, sidebar/canvas label, tooltips, `chat_agent_registry.display_name`, docs prose, the `"STM32er AGENT STARTED"` log). Lowercase `stm32er` is correct ONLY for the dir / pool name / `<name>.py` / CSS class `.canvas-item.stm32er-agent` / JS classMap key / `name.toLowerCase()` connection checks. The section tokens `INI_SECTION_STM32ER` / `END_SECTION_STM32ER` and the FlowHypervisor `STM32ER SPECIAL NOTES:` header stay **ALL-CAPS** (separate convention — do NOT "fix" them to match the display name). The wrapped tool is `chat_agent_stm32er`. See the **`tlamatini-agent-naming`** project skill and CLAUDE.md's "⚠️ Agent Naming Convention" section.
  Other surfaces kept aligned (change together): `requirements.txt` pins `pyserial==3.5`; `agent/test_stm32er_agent.py` (122 tests; E2E-verified against a real STM32 Template Project MCP server — found an ST-LINK on COM3); `agents_descriptions.md` + `agentic_skill.md` + README/Book carry the same surface. **Frozen mode needs no `build.py` change** — `build.py` copies `agent/agents/` wholesale and ships `agents_descriptions.md`; post-build `migrate` seeds the Agent + Tool rows.

- **Loaded `<context>` now beats `<self_knowledge>` — "summarize the project's source code in the provided context" no longer summarizes Tlamatini herself — 2026-05-25** — After the self-modify work landed (`a927f5c`/`2aab751`), `prompt.pmt` always injects a large, authoritative `<self_knowledge>` block (the live `Tlamatini.md`) whose intro told the LLM to "lean on it whenever the user's prompt concerns ... your architecture". The user-loaded directory/file (attached via the chat **Context menu**) lands in a *separate* `<context>` block. There was **no rule disambiguating the two**, so a generic prompt like *"Summarize in very detail the project's source code in the provided context"* made Tlamatini summarize **herself** (from `Tlamatini.md`) instead of the loaded project. **Fix (two layers, both required):** (1) **Prompt contract (`Tlamatini/agent/prompt.pmt`)** — the `<self_knowledge>` block intro now carries a **CRITICAL SCOPE** clause ("this block describes ONLY you ... it is NEVER the user's loaded project"; defer to `<context>` for "the project / the source code / the provided context / this codebase / the loaded files" unless the user *explicitly* names Tlamatini/you/this-system/yourself), and **Rule 5 (Context usage)** gained a top-of-rule **"Loaded-context priority"** clause: when `<context>` is non-empty it is the PRIMARY subject and the loaded `<context>` **ALWAYS wins over self-knowledge** for generic project/code requests. Because the `{self_knowledge}` and `{context}` placeholders are shared by ALL chains (basic / history-aware / unified / prompt-only), this single prompt edit fixes every chain uniformly. (2) **Deterministic, model-agnostic reinforcement** — new `agent/rag/utils.py::prepend_loaded_context_scope()` (+ shared `_LOADED_CONTEXT_SCOPE_HEADER`) prefixes the user-loaded context blob with a "LOADED USER CONTEXT — the USER'S own project, NOT Tlamatini's own source code ..." header before it is bound to the prompt/agent input, so even a weak local Ollama model can't confuse the two. Applied in `OptimizedHistoryAwareRAGChain.invoke` (`rag/chains/history_aware.py`), `UnifiedAgentRAGChain.invoke` + `UnifiedAgentChain.invoke` (`rag/chains/unified.py`), and `BasicPromptOnlyChain.invoke` (`rag/chains/basic.py`). **The header is applied only to the value bound to the prompt — the blob saved by `save_context_blob()` stays the raw retrieved text** (don't move the prefix above the save call). The `UnifiedAgentChain` fallback keeps its pre-existing `"Loaded Context from Knowledge Base Fallback:"` label (a test asserts it) and only *adds* the "NOT Tlamatini's own" scoping. **DO NOT** revert the self-knowledge intro to the un-scoped wording or drop the Rule 5 priority clause — that re-introduces the "summarized myself" bug. **DO NOT** remove `prepend_loaded_context_scope` from any one chain — the regression guard `LoadedContextPriorityTests.test_all_loaded_context_chains_apply_the_scope_header` greps all three chain modules for the call. Coverage: `LoadedContextPriorityTests` (6) in `agent/tests.py` + the pre-existing `LoadedContextFallbackTests` (6) still green; ruff clean. No frontend/JS change (the Context-menu plumbing was already correct — this was purely a prompt-priority/disambiguation fix). Works in source AND frozen mode with no rebuild, since `prompt.pmt`, `Tlamatini.md`, and the chain code are all read/run at runtime from the application directory.

- **"Set directory as context" now loads nested project sub-directories (native picker sends the FULL path) — 2026-05-25** — Loading a codebase that lived more than one level under the app root via the chat **Context ▸ Set directory as context** menu failed with the generic *"Your agent cannot process your requests. Check that you didn't specify context outside of the root directory."* — in BOTH frozen and source mode — even though the directory was a perfectly valid descendant of the application root. **Root cause was in the FRONTEND, not the path validator**: the menu handler used the browser's `window.showDirectoryPicker()`, whose `FileSystemDirectoryHandle.name` exposes **only the leaf folder name** (e.g. `"src"`), never the full path (a hard browser-security limitation). The server then resolved that bare name with `path_guard.safe_join_under(runtime_root, "src")`, which only exists when the folder is a **direct child** of the runtime root — so `<app>/applications/proj/src` became `<runtime_root>/src`, didn't exist, the RAG build returned `None`, and the catch-all error fired. Direct children of the install dir happened to work in frozen mode (runtime_root == install dir), which is why it looked like "only depth-1 works". **Fix (mirrors the existing Set-DB / Backup-DB Browse buttons exactly):** (1) new backend view `views.pick_context_directory_view` + route `pick_context_directory/` (`urls.py`) drives the native server-side Win32 folder picker (`_run_native_picker('directory', …)` → `native_dialogs.pick_folder`) and returns the **real absolute path** (`{"path": "<abs>"}` / `{"path":"","canceled":true}` / `_picker_failure_payload`); (2) `agent_page_init.js` `setDirContextMenu` handler now `fetch`es that endpoint via the new `_pickContextDirectory()` helper (with `_promptForContextDirectory()` manual-entry fallback when the native dialog is unavailable, e.g. non-Windows) and sends the full path in `set-directory-as-context` — `window.showDirectoryPicker()` is gone; (3) `path_guard.py` gained `is_within_application_root(path)` (depth-agnostic, mode-aware via `_get_application_root()`) and `resolve_runtime_agent_path` now accepts an absolute path that is the application root **or any descendant of it at any depth**, in addition to the existing runtime-root and `allowed_paths` rules — so a deep nested project is accepted regardless of whether `"application"` is still in `config.json.allowed_paths`. **DO NOT revert the frontend back to `showDirectoryPicker()`** — it structurally cannot send the full path and silently re-breaks every non-direct-child directory. The application-root relaxation is **scoped, not open**: a path under no allowed root is still rejected (covered by a test). Coverage: `SetDirectoryAsContextPathTests` (6: depth-agnostic accept, sibling reject, deep-subdir resolve, outside-everything reject, **frozen-mode** root+nested resolve, source-mode ancestor invariant) + `ContextDirectoryPickerViewTests` (4: full-path, cancel, picker-unavailable, auth-required) in `agent/tests.py`; ruff + ESLint clean. (Pre-existing, unrelated: `PromptValidationDecisionTests.test_seeded_prompts_use_deterministic_validation_only` fails on a seeded `.java`-listing demo prompt that reaches the LLM indirect classifier — that path never touches `resolve_runtime_agent_path`/`is_within_application_root`.)

- **Extended Unreal MCP fork published — `XAIHT/XaihtUnrealEngineMCP` is the canonical "MCP git location" — 2026-05-24** — The improved Unreal MCP plugin the Unrealer agent targets (the 53-verb / 9-category surface previously living **uncommitted** at the local working copy `C:\Development\unreal-mcp`) now has a public canonical home: **`https://github.com/XAIHT/XaihtUnrealEngineMCP.git`** — "the Unreal Engine MCP modified specifically for Tlamatini." This was a **docs-reference pass only** (no code / agent / migration changes): the new repo is named as the recommended, drop-in plugin (built on upstream `chongdashu/unreal-mcp`, identical wire protocol + `127.0.0.1:55557` port + `UnrealMCP` folder name) across `README.md` §6.2 (heading renamed "Upstream plugin" → "The MCP plugin source"; its TOC anchor updated in lock-step — **do not change one without the other**), §6 intro, §6.4; `BookOfTlamatini.md` §57.1 / §57.2 / §57.5 / glossary + a new Recent-Updates entry; `agents_descriptions.md`; `docs/claude/agents.md`; `agentic_skill.md` #60; `KIMI.md`. The upstream `chongdashu/unreal-mcp` is still named as the canonical base the `UnrealConnection` adapter mirrors verbatim. When a future fork supersedes this one, update the same place-set together (they were deliberately kept aligned).

- **Unrealer per-command read-timeout floors: `create_material` shader-compile no longer aborts the chain — 2026-05-24** — Two consecutive "Scene Forge" demo runs *partially* failed: `get_current_level` → `list_assets` → `create_folder` (all ok) → **`create_material` timed out at the flat 10 s** → then `create_material_instance` ("Parent material not found"), `set_material_parameter` ("Material instance not found"), and `assign_material` ("Material not found") all cascaded off that single abort (only `spawn_actor` / `take_screenshot` / `save_all` survived). Root cause (confirmed in the upstream C++ `FUnrealMCPMaterialCommands::HandleCreateMaterial` at `C:\Development\unreal-mcp\…\UnrealMCPMaterialCommands.cpp`): it calls `IAssetTools::CreateAsset(...)` which **synchronously compiles the new material's shaders on the editor game thread before it returns**, and the FIRST material in a fresh editor session (cold shader DDC + compiler-worker spin-up) routinely needs 15-40 s — so the agent's `recv` hit the 10 s read-timeout while a valid op was still compiling, the material was never finished, and every dependent step then 404'd. This is NOT the modal-dialog case (that fails fast as a *connection* error, not a clean recv timeout). Fix in `agent/agents/unrealer/unrealer.py`: (1) new module-level `_SLOW_COMMAND_TIMEOUT_FLOORS` map giving compute-bound commands a per-command recv-timeout floor (`create_material` 60 s, `create_material_instance`/`set_material_parameter`/`new_level` 45 s, `compile_blueprint`/`execute_python`/`open_level` 60 s, `import_asset` 90 s) + `_effective_read_timeout(command, configured) = max(configured, floor)` — so an operator's explicit higher `read_timeout` is never lowered, and unknown read/query commands keep the configured value verbatim; (2) `main()` computes the effective timeout per run and logs `↳ '<cmd>' is a known slow operation; raising read_timeout 10s → 60s`; (3) new `_COMPILE_SLOW_COMMANDS` frozenset so `_diagnose_no_response` appends a **shader-compile** remedy (distinct from the existing `_MODAL_PRONE_COMMANDS` Save-dialog remedy) — "cold DDC still warming up, retry; or a Python script blocked on input; verify the asset exists before chaining". **`save_*` are deliberately NOT floored** — a save that hangs is parked on an unclearable modal dialog, so a short timeout surfaces the actionable diagnostic faster (a real, already-pathed level saves sub-second). The floor lives in `unrealer.py` itself, NOT config.yaml, so it applies regardless of how the per-run config is generated (chat tool, canvas, or `.flw`). **The running frozen install `C:\Tlamatini\agents\unrealer\{unrealer.py,config.yaml}` was patched in place** (byte-identical template copied per chat-run) so the next Unrealer run benefits without a rebuild. Coverage: `EffectiveReadTimeoutTests` (6) + 3 new `DiagnoseNoResponseTests` in `agent/test_unrealer_agent.py` (37 → 46 green; a guard test asserts every floored command is also modal-prone and/or compile-slow so no floor is silent); ruff clean. Builds on the 2026-05-24 save-timeout entry below — same subsystem, complementary fix (that one stopped the *unsafe double-wait retry*; this one stops the *premature abort* of slow-but-valid ops). **DO NOT lower these floors to a single global timeout** — the read/query commands genuinely answer in <1 s and the compile commands genuinely need tens of seconds; one number cannot serve both.

- **Unrealer save-on-Untitled-level timeout: no retry + actionable diagnostic — 2026-05-24** — A Multi-Turn flow (`get_current_level` → `spawn_actor` → `take_screenshot` → `save_current_level`) failed at the save step with an opaque `Timeout receiving Unreal response` and burned **20 seconds** doing it. Root cause: the upstream C++ `FUnrealMCPLevelCommands::HandleSaveCurrentLevel` calls `UEditorLoadingAndSavingUtils::SaveCurrentLevel()`, which on a never-saved "Untitled" level pops a **modal Save-As dialog** (no path arg) — the editor's game thread parks on the dialog, the plugin never writes a response, and our `recv` hits the 10 s read-timeout. The agent's `send_command` retry set included `"timeout"`, so it re-sent and waited a **second** full read-timeout for a command that can never succeed by repeating. Two fixes in `agent/agents/unrealer/unrealer.py` (`UnrealConnection.send_command`): (1) **`"timeout"` removed from the transient-retry set** — that retry exists ONLY to mask the connect-time race (which fails *instantly* as `"connection closed before receiving data"`; `connection closed`/`connection reset`/`broken pipe` are still retried). A full read-timeout is a different failure: retrying it doubles the wall-clock wait AND is **unsafe for state-changing commands** (the first `spawn_actor`/`save` may still be queued/running — a retry could execute it twice). (2) New module-level `_diagnose_no_response(command, base_error, read_timeout)` + `_MODAL_PRONE_COMMANDS` set (`save_current_level`/`save_all`/`save_asset`/`open_level`/`new_level`) rewrites the bare timeout into a single-line actionable message that names the command, the elapsed timeout, the `read_timeout` knob, and — for the save/level commands — the modal-dialog cause and remedy (give the level a real package path first, or use `new_level` with `params.path`; `save_all` also prompts for a never-saved map). **DO NOT re-add `"timeout"` to the transient set** — it re-introduces the 20 s double-wait and the double-execution hazard. The standalone `save_all` (`SaveDirtyPackages(true,true)`) and `new_level` (accepts a `path` to save silently) are the non-interactive escape hatches; `save_current_level` has none. **The running frozen install `C:\Tlamatini\agents\unrealer\unrealer.py` was patched in place** (byte-identical master template copied per chat-run) so new Unrealer runs benefit without a rebuild. Coverage: `DiagnoseNoResponseTests` (4) + `SendCommandRetryTests` (4) in `agent/test_unrealer_agent.py` (29 → 37 green); ruff clean. NOTE (separate, not fixed here): the wrapped `chat_agent_unrealer` config writer leaks `text: '<command-name>'` and the typed-default placeholders (`recursive`/`slot`/`font_size`/`z_order`/`is_exposed`) into every command's params — harmless (the plugin ignores unknown keys) but noisy in the logs; a per-command param allow-list would be the real fix and lives in the wrapped-launch path, not `unrealer.py`.

- **Unrealer expanded to the 53-command / 9-category Unreal MCP surface + 3 demo prompts — 2026-05-24** — Tracks the improved Unreal MCP fork at `C:\Development\unreal-mcp` (uncommitted P0/P1/P2 work). **The authoritative TCP command surface is the C++ dispatch in `UnrealMCPBridge.cpp::ExecuteCommand`, NOT the Python FastMCP tools** (Unrealer talks the raw socket directly): base editor/blueprint/node/project/umg PLUS new **system** (`execute_python`/`execute_console_command`/`get_class_info`/`list_assets`), **level**, **asset**, **material** categories and new verbs (`take_screenshot`/`focus_viewport`/`create_actor`/`set_pawn_properties`/`find_blueprint_nodes`) = **53 verbs / 9 categories**. **The P3 automation tools (`build_project`/`run_automation_tests`/`run_macro`) are NOT bridge commands** — they shell out to `UnrealEditor-Cmd` / loop `send_command` in Python and are unreachable over the editor TCP socket; do NOT advertise them to Unrealer (the canvas equivalent of `run_macro` is chaining Unrealer nodes via Parametrizer). `unrealer.py` is a generic forwarder so it needed no new verbs, but three forwarder fixups were added that MUST stay aligned with `config.yaml`'s placeholder catalog: (1) `_CONTENT_PATH_PARAM_KEYS` extended with `destination_path`/`source`/`destination`/`parent_material`/`material` — disk-path keys `source_file`/`filepath` are deliberately EXCLUDED (never `/Content/`→`/Game/`-normalize a disk path); (2) `_remap_console_command` maps `params.console_command` → wire `params.command` for `execute_console_command` (its param name collides with the agent's top-level `command:` selector, which would make a bare `command=` override ambiguous); (3) `_prune_unset_params` drops `''`/`[]`/`{}`/`None` placeholders before send (keeps `0`/`False`). **Every new command's params MUST exist as a `config.yaml` placeholder** or `_resolve_config_path` (tools.py) drops/errors the dotted `params.X` override — the Flow Compiler only writes leaves that already exist — and the prune keeps that large catalog from flooding every command with empty args. `recursive` defaults `true` and `slot` defaults `0` (always-sent typed defaults). Migration `0100_add_unrealer_extended_demo_prompts.py` appends 3 tiered demos at idPrompt **60/61/62** (Snapshot / Scene Forge / Python+Introspection) exercising the new surface — append-only, catalog now contiguous 1-62, `update_or_create`, depends on `0099`; the existing idPrompt 25 (`0087`) covers only the base categories. The `execute_python` demo passes multi-line code as a TRIPLE-QUOTED `params.code='''…'''` — the NL assignment parser (`_split_assignment_segments` / `_coerce_assignment_value`) is triple-quote-aware so internal `=` / newlines / quotes survive. **Surfaces kept aligned (change together when the verb set changes):** `chat_agent_registry.py` purpose/aliases/security_hints, `config.yaml` header + placeholders, `unrealer.py` fixups, `agents_descriptions.md`, `agentic_skill.md` #60 + catalog line, `README.md` §6, `docs/claude/agents.md`, `KIMI.md`, `BookOfTlamatini.md` §57, `doc_generation/complete_project_docs.py`, `flowhypervisor/monitoring-prompt.pmt`. Coverage: `agent/test_unrealer_agent.py` (29 tests). Also fixed the long-stale **README/Book `idPrompt 32`→`25`** (the Unrealer base demo has always been seeded at 25).

- **Kalier "embedded client" — config-injected Kali server URL — 2026-05-23** — Makes the chat UX "paste the Linux block on Kali → enable Multi-Turn + Exec-Report → just prompt 'scan 10.0.0.5 and give me a report'" work WITHOUT the user (or LLM) ever repeating the Kali box URL — Tlamatini IS the client now (the embedded replacement for Claude Desktop's `client.py --server http://IP:5000`; the old guide is `Claude-Desktop-KALI-MCP-Session.md`, the new one is `Tlamatini-Kali-Setup.md` at the repo root). New config key **`config.json` → `kali_server_url`** (default `http://127.0.0.1:5000`, a non-secret — works for WSL2 localhost-forwarding / SSH-tunnel out of the box; editable via **Config ▸ URLs**, wired in `views.CONFIG_URL_KEYS` + `CONFIG_URL_URL_FIELDS`, plus the `data-config-key="kali_server_url"` input in `agent_page.html`). The injection point is **`tools.py::_seed_global_agent_defaults(template_dir, runtime_config)`**, called from `_launch_wrapped_chat_agent` **BEFORE** `_apply_requested_assignments_to_config` so the seeded default is overridable — an explicit `server_url=` in the LLM's request still wins (ordering contract is locked by a source-level test). It is **kalier-only** (guarded on `template_dir == "kalier"`), reads via `get_config_value` (imported into `tools.py`), and **fails open** (any read error / blank / None / non-str value leaves the template default — a broken config read must never crash a wrapped-tool launch). The registry `purpose` in `chat_agent_registry.py` was flipped from "ALWAYS pass server_url" to "DO NOT pass server_url normally — Tlamatini injects the configured box; only override for a one-off different box". The standalone `kalier.py` and its `config.yaml` default are UNCHANGED (canvas/.flw runs still set `server_url` in the node dialog). Coverage: `EmbeddedClientConfigTests` + `EmbeddedClientEndpointTests` in `agent/test_kalier_agent.py` (25 new tests; module now 83 green). When you change the config key name or the injection ordering, keep `_seed_global_agent_defaults`, the `views` URL-key tuples, the HTML input, and the registry purpose aligned.

- **Kalier agent — Kali Linux / MCP-Kali-Server bridge, dual-surface + skill — 2026-05-22** — Kalier (agent #66 in `agentic_skill.md`, FlowCreator bumped to #67; catalog now **67** / wrapped chat-agents now **42** / **74** Multi-Turn tools / skills now **24**; migrations `0097_add_kalier` + `0098_add_chat_agent_kalier_tool`) integrates the **MCP-Kali-Server** (`https://www.kali.org/tools/mcp-kali-server/`) for AI-assisted pentesting/recon/CTF, on BOTH surfaces (canvas node + wrapped `chat_agent_kalier`) PLUS a `kali-pentest` SKILL.md companion (chat-surface runbook, mirroring Reviewer→code-review / Analyzer→security-audit). Non-obvious points: (1) **It bridges to the Flask API half over HTTP with stdlib `urllib`, NOT the FastMCP stdio half and NOT `requests`/`mcp`.** Upstream ships `server.py` (Flask API on the Kali box: `/api/command`, `/api/tools/<tool>`, `/health`) + `client.py` (a thin FastMCP→HTTP bridge); `agent/agents/kalier/kalier.py` ports the `KaliToolsClient` HTTP logic inline with `urllib` (Apirer's pattern) — no `agent.*` import (Pitfall #10), no third-party deps in the pool subprocess, identical in source + frozen. `server_url` defaults to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` (remote Kali → SSH tunnel). (2) **`action` selects the capability** ∈ `command`/`nmap`/`gobuster`/`dirb`/`nikto`/`sqlmap`/`metasploit`/`hydra`/`john`/`wpscan`/`enum4linux`/`health`; `_build_payload` sends only that action's params so the server applies its own defaults. metasploit `options` may arrive as a JSON string (the flat wrapped grammar can't express a dict) → `kalier.py` `json.loads` it. (3) **State-changing**, so it IS in `_EXEC_REPORT_TOOLS` under `agent_key="kalier"` (read-only `health` shares the key). It emits `INI_SECTION_KALIER` and ALWAYS triggers `target_agents` (success OR failure) so a Forker can branch on `{success}`/`{return_code}`; `success: false` / `timed_out: true` is routable evidence, NOT an error — FlowHypervisor `monitoring-prompt.pmt` KALIER SPECIAL NOTES codifies this (a silent scan up to ~3 min is normal; only "Cannot reach MCP-Kali-Server" is a real fault). (4) **Builtin contract with `secret_paths=('password',)`** in `agent_contracts._BUILTIN_CONTRACTS` (redacts the hydra single-password from `.flw` exports); parametrizer fields in `_PARAMETRIZER_OUTPUT_FIELDS['kalier']` = `action, endpoint, method, subject, return_code, success, timed_out, server_url, response_body` + `parametrizer.SECTION_AGENT_TYPES`. (5) Connection wiring mirrors Windower/Mouser exactly (source-side only, 3-param `updateKalierConnection`, writes `target_agents`). **Frozen mode needs no build.py change** — `build.py` copies `agent/agents/` + `agent/skills_pkg/` wholesale and ships `agents_descriptions.md`; post-build `migrate` seeds the Agent+Tool rows. **Authorized targets only.** When you change the action set, change `kalier.py::_ACTION_ROUTES`/`_build_payload`, the registry `purpose`, the Flow-Generator branch in `agent_page_chat.js`, the `agentic_skill.md` #66 entry, and the `kali-pentest` SKILL.md together.

- **Playwrighter `hold_open_seconds` / `hold_open_ms` linger before close — 2026-05-21** — Playwrighter closed the browser the instant the last step returned (`run_browser_flow`'s `finally` tears the browser down with no delay), so a user's "wait 10 seconds before closing so I can watch it" was silently ignored — and the LLM did NOT append a trailing `{"action":"wait"}` step (fragile to rely on anyway). The fix adds a dedicated linger honored AFTER the last step and BEFORE close, on success OR a mid-flow error (a failed run is exactly when watching helps): `hold_open_seconds` (natural unit) with `hold_open_ms` as a finer alias that wins when both are > 0. Five surfaces stay aligned: (1) `agent/agents/playwrighter/playwrighter.py` — new `_coerce_int` (never raises on a bad value → a malformed linger can't abort a good run), reads both keys in `run_browser_flow`, `page.wait_for_timeout(hold_open_total_ms)` right before the close `finally`; (2) `agent/agents/playwrighter/config.yaml` — `hold_open_seconds: 0` / `hold_open_ms: 0` MUST exist as keys because the wrapped-tool config writer (`tools._apply_requested_assignments_to_config`) silently IGNORES any requested key that is not already a resolvable config path; (3) `agent/chat_agent_registry.py` — Playwrighter `purpose` now tells the LLM to pass `hold_open_seconds=<N>` on "wait before closing / let me watch it" prompts (do NOT rely on a trailing wait step); (4) `agent/static/agent/js/agent_page_chat.js::_mapToolArgsToAgentConfig` — Playwrighter branch maps both keys onto the Create-Flow node config; (5) migration `0095` BROWSER SPOTLIGHT (#53) + BROWSER WIZARD demos now pass `hold_open_seconds=10`. Honored regardless of `headless` (harmless when `headless=true`). Coverage: 6 new tests in `agent/test_playwrighter_agent.py` (60 total green), ruff + ESLint clean. **The running frozen install `C:\Tlamatini\agents\playwrighter\{playwrighter.py,config.yaml}` was patched in place** so the capability works without a rebuild — BUT the registry `purpose` + demo-prompt migration are baked into the frozen executable, so without a rebuild the LLM won't auto-translate natural-language "wait N seconds" → `hold_open_seconds`; in that case pass `hold_open_seconds=10` explicitly in the `chat_agent_playwrighter` call. When you change the linger semantics keep all five surfaces aligned.

- **Windower agent — Win32 window manager, dual-surface — 2026-05-21** — Windower (agent #65 in `agentic_skill.md`, FlowCreator bumped to #66; catalog now **66** / wrapped chat-agents now **41** / **73** Multi-Turn tools; migrations `0093_add_windower` + `0094_add_chat_agent_windower_tool`) is the **window manager** of the desktop-UI trio (Windower=the window itself, Mouser=clicks-inside, Keyboarder=types-into) and ships on BOTH surfaces (canvas node + wrapped `chat_agent_windower`), the same dual pattern as Playwrighter/Unrealer. `action` ∈ `list` / `focus` / `minimize` / `maximize` / `restore` / `move` / `resize` / `move_resize` / `close` / `topmost` / `untopmost` / `arrange`. Non-obvious points: (1) **Self-contained Win32, NOT the Windows-MCP server.** `agent/agents/windower/windower.py` ports the *window-management subset* of Microsoft's Windows-MCP (`https://github.com/CursorTouch/Windows-MCP`) inline using only `pywin32` (`win32gui`/`win32con`/`win32process`) + `ctypes` — it does NOT import `agent.*` (pool subprocesses have no path back into Django, Pitfall #10) and does NOT pull the heavy Windows-MCP stack (fastmcp/comtypes/dxcam/uiautomation). The genuinely valuable bit ported verbatim is the **AttachThreadInput focus-transfer dance** in `bring_to_front()` — a plain `SetForegroundWindow` fails cross-process, so it attaches the caller thread to both the current-foreground and target threads to make the focus change stick. All Win32 imports are guarded → a non-Windows / stripped host degrades to `state: win32_unavailable` instead of crashing the chain. (2) **It is state-changing** (moves/resizes/closes windows), so it IS in `_EXEC_REPORT_TOOLS` under `agent_key="windower"` — the read-only `list` action shares that key on purpose so a mixed flow renders as one "List of Windower Operations" table. Mouser-vs-Windower hint split is deliberate: "the window itself" verbs (bring to front/maximize/resize/close/tile/list) score Windower; "click the control" verbs stay Mouser. (3) **Parametrizer fields** live in `agent_contracts._PARAMETRIZER_OUTPUT_FIELDS['windower']` = `action, window_title, matched, match_count, state, left, top, width, height, response_body` (auto-merged onto the disk-discovered contract — no `_BUILTIN_CONTRACTS` entry needed since it has plain `target_agents`) + `parametrizer.SECTION_AGENT_TYPES`. It emits `INI_SECTION_WINDOWER` and ALWAYS triggers `target_agents` (success or soft no-op); set `fail_if_absent=true` to hard-exit non-zero when no window matches so an upstream Forker can branch. Connection wiring mirrors Mouser/Shoter exactly (source-side only, 3-param `updateWindowerConnection`, writes `target_agents`). When you change the action verbs, change `windower.py::dispatch`, the registry `purpose`, the Flow-Generator branch in `agent_page_chat.js::_mapToolArgsToAgentConfig`, and the `agentic_skill.md` #65 entry together.

- **Playwrighter agent — scripted browser automation, two input shapes — 2026-05-20** — Playwrighter (agent #65, catalog now **65** / wrapped chat-agents now **40** / **72** Multi-Turn tools) drives a real browser (Playwright) through a declarative step list and ships on BOTH surfaces (canvas node + wrapped `chat_agent_playwrighter`), the same dual pattern as Unrealer. Three things are non-obvious: (1) **The script has two valid input shapes that must stay interchangeable.** The canvas authors a YAML `steps:` list in `config.yaml`; the chat/Multi-Turn LLM passes the whole script as a single JSON string in **`steps_json`** because the flat `key=value` wrapped-request grammar cannot express a list-of-dicts (the request splitter in `tools.py` keeps the JSON intact only because it's inside one set of single-quotes). `agent/agents/playwrighter/playwrighter.py` `json.loads` `steps_json` and it **wins over** the YAML `steps`. The Flow-Generator branch in `agent_page_chat.js::_mapToolArgsToAgentConfig` parses `steps_json` back into a `steps` list so a Create-Flow download is canvas-shaped. If you change the step verbs, change all three (the agent's `_run_one_step`, the registry `purpose`/`example_request`, and the Flow-Generator branch) together. (2) **The pool agent calls `playwright.sync_api` directly — do NOT wrap it in a `ThreadPoolExecutor`.** The ThreadPoolExecutor dance is only required by the in-process `googler` tool (it runs inside Django Channels' asyncio loop where `sync_playwright()` raises `NotImplementedError`); pool agents are separate subprocesses with no event loop, so they call it directly like `googler.py`'s agent does. (3) **It is state-changing** (submits forms, logs in, downloads), so it IS in `_EXEC_REPORT_TOOLS` under `agent_key="playwrighter"` — unlike Crawler/Googler which are read-only and stay out of the Exec Report. Parametrizer fields: `start_url`, `final_url`, `status`, `steps_run`, `assert_result`, `response_body`; it ALWAYS triggers `target_agents` (success or failure) so a Forker can branch on `{assert_result}`/`{status}`. Migrations `0091_add_playwrighter` + `0092_add_chat_agent_playwrighter_tool`.

- **Image interpretation NEVER opens a viewer window — 2026-05-20** — A Multi-Turn flow that *starts from* an "interpret / describe / analyze / read / OCR / what's-in-this-image" prompt must route the work through a VISION tool that returns TEXT and opens no window: `chat_agent_image_interpreter` (canonical), `opus_analyze_image` (Claude), or `qwen_analyze_image` (Qwen). It must **NEVER** call `launch_view_image` to satisfy interpretation — that tool ONLY pops a viewer (os.startfile / Start-Process) and produces zero analysis. A window is opened ONLY when the user EXPLICITLY asks to view/show/open/display the image. This is codified in `agent/prompt.pmt` Rule 11 as the **"Image-interpretation tool-choice rule"** (sibling of the code-authorship rule), and mirrored across four surfaces that MUST stay aligned: (1) `launch_view_image`'s docstring in `agent/tools.py` (now states "ONLY opens a viewer, produces no analysis; never for interpretation"); (2) the `chat_agent_image_interpreter` `purpose` string in `agent/chat_agent_registry.py`; (3) the `opus_analyze_image` / `qwen_analyze_image` docstrings in `agent/imaging/image_interpreter.py`; (4) the planner's capability hints in `agent/capability_registry.py::_EXTRA_HINTS_BY_TOOL_NAME` — `launch_view_image` hints were narrowed to explicit VIEW-verb phrases only (no bare "image"/"picture" nouns, which collide with interpret prompts), and `opus_analyze_image` / `qwen_analyze_image` gained interpret/describe/OCR hints (plus the wrapped interpreter's `security_hints` were broadened) so on an interpretation prompt the vision tools score ~22-46 while the viewer scores 0-2, guaranteeing the planner binds the interpreter, not the viewer. When you touch any one of these five surfaces, keep the phrasing aligned across all five — divergence re-introduces the "described an image by popping a window instead of reading it" failure.

- **Reviewer commit-state + secret-handling precision — v1.4.2, 2026-05-20** — Patch (commit `2e1c2d0`, tag `v1.4.2`) that kills the Reviewer agent's #1 false positive: calling the developer's local working-copy credentials "API keys committed to source". `agent/agents/reviewer/reviewer.py::build_review_prompt(diff_text, stat_text, focus, diff_ref="")` gained the `diff_ref` arg (passed from `main()`) and now prepends two grounding blocks to the prompt: (1) a **COMMIT-STATE** block — empty `diff_ref` ⇒ the diff is the UNCOMMITTED working tree + staged area, so the model MUST NOT say "committed"/"pushed" (only "staged"/"in the working tree"); a non-empty `diff_ref` naming committed history may be called "committed"; (2) a **SECRET-HANDLING CONVENTION** block teaching the `regen_secrets.py` scrub convention — `agent/config.json` + `agent/agents/*/config.yaml` hold local "keyed" credentials in the working copy and are scrubbed to `<NAME goes here>` placeholders (real values only in gitignored `data.keys`) before any commit, so placeholders/empties are never secrets and real-looking creds in those managed files inside an uncommitted diff are expected local state (≤1 low-severity "run `regen_secrets.py --mode push-able`" note), while genuine secrets in source code or outside that managed set are still hard-flagged. The identical two rules are mirrored into `agent/skills_pkg/code_review/SKILL.md` (new "Secret findings — read before flagging credentials" section + commit-state wording in the diff-resolution / Security steps) so the `code-review` skill and the canvas Reviewer agent never diverge. Also bundled: migration `0090_add_reviewer_analyzer_demo_prompts.py` (idPrompt 26 code-review / 27 security-audit). Agent/skill counts unchanged (64 / 23) — accuracy patch, not new capability. **When editing either the secret or commit-state ruleset, change BOTH `reviewer.py` and `code_review/SKILL.md` together** — they are intentional verbatim mirrors.

- **Reviewer + Analyzer agents & code-review/security-audit skills — v1.4.2, 2026-05-20** — Delivered the roadmap's Reviewer (#2) and Analyzer (#3) as **canvas-only** workflow agents (#63/#64; migrations `0088_add_reviewer`/`0089_add_analyzer`) plus their LLM-facing twins as SKILL.md packages (`code_review/SKILL.md` name `code-review`, `security_audit/SKILL.md` name `security-audit` — skill catalog now **23**, agent catalog **64**). Reviewer = LLM `git diff` review emitting `INI_SECTION_REVIEWER` with a `verdict` (APPROVE/REQUEST_CHANGES/COMMENT); Analyzer = deterministic multi-scanner (bandit/semgrep/ruff/eslint/gitleaks/pip-audit) emitting `INI_SECTION_ANALYZER` with `status` (clean/findings/error) + `total_findings`. Both ALWAYS trigger `target_agents` so a Forker can branch on `{verdict}`/`{status}`. **Deliberately NO wrapped `chat_agent_*` tool** — the two skills cover the chat surface, so neither agent is in `_EXEC_REPORT_TOOLS` (canvas-only agents never enter the Exec Report). Parametrizer fields live in `agent_contracts._PARAMETRIZER_OUTPUT_FIELDS` + `parametrizer.SECTION_AGENT_TYPES`; the two new connector fns were added to `eslint.config.mjs` globals (the real source of truth for cross-file JS connector functions — NOT the per-file `/* global */` comments, which is why ESLint still passes with 0 errors despite the comments not listing every fn). **Frozen + source both verified**: `build.py` copies `agent/agents` and `agent/skills_pkg` **wholesale** (`shutil.copytree`, not an enumerated list), runs `migrate` + `collectstatic`, and ships `agents_descriptions.md` — so the new agent dirs, DB rows, skills, and static assets land exactly where the frozen resolvers (`get_agents_root`, `skill_registry._default_roots`, `views._find_path`) look. Skills auto-discover from disk (no migration). Doc counts bumped 62→64 / 21→23 across CLAUDE.md, docs/claude/*, README.md, BookOfTlamatini.md, KIMI.md, agentic_skill.md, agents_descriptions.md; FlowHypervisor `monitoring-prompt.pmt` gained REVIEWER/ANALYZER notes (verdict `REQUEST_CHANGES` and status `findings` are NOT flow errors — they are routable content for a downstream Forker).

- **prompt.pmt PRIME DIRECTIVE + Rule 14 styling contract — v1.3.2, 2026-05-19** — `Tlamatini/agent/prompt.pmt` now opens its rules block with a **PRIME DIRECTIVE** banner that outranks every other styling concern: every HTML element the LLM emits MUST carry both an explicit `background` AND an explicit `color:` on the SAME element AND on every text-bearing child; body text is `#0f172a` on light backgrounds and `#ffffff` on dark; `<tbody> <td>` is ALWAYS light-background with dark text (`background:#ffffff;color:#0f172a;…` or stripe-row `#f1f5f9`); the medium-grey list (`#94a3b8 / #9ca3af / #a0a0a0 / #c0c0c0 …`) is HARD-BANNED for body text on any coloured background; three named failure patterns (`image.png` light-pastel-no-color, `image copy.png` grey-on-dark-purple-tbody, `image copy 2.png` transparent-tbody-grey-text) are banned by name. The detail-level companion is the new Rule 14 (palette pairings ≥ 7:1 / WCAG AAA, banner / panel / table templates, banned-grey hex list, mandatory silent self-check before `END-RESPONSE`). **Rule 14 was renumbered**: the previous Rule 14 (Conflict resolution rule) is now **Rule 15**. If you wrote code that grepped for `rule 14|14\)` referring to "conflict resolution", update it to `rule 15`. The Prime Directive itself explicitly overrides Rule 15 for visual-readability conflicts. Existing references that were renumbered correctly: none yet — both surfaces that previously named "rule 12" / "rule 13" (`docs/claude/acpx.md`, the ASCII diagrams rule) are unaffected. Touched by commit `141d104`.

- **Tool-choice rule: file_creator / pythonxer / executer >> keyboarder / mouser for code authorship — v1.3.1, 2026-05-18** — `prompt.pmt` gained a **Code-authorship tool-choice rule** (top of Rule 8) and a **Keyboarder / Mouser explicit-instruction rule** (commit `9392af4`). To AUTHOR / WRITE code or scripts or configs, prefer (in this order) `chat_agent_file_creator` → `chat_agent_pythonxer` → `chat_agent_executer`. **NEVER drive `chat_agent_keyboarder` or `chat_agent_mouser` to type source code or click through editors.** Keyboarder / Mouser are reserved for genuine desktop-UI automation explicitly named by the user, or when there is genuinely no programmatic alternative. The same guidance is mirrored into `chat_agent_registry.py` (purpose strings for executer / pythonxer / file_creator / keyboarder / mouser), `agent/tools.py` (`execute_file` / `execute_command` docstrings), and `agents_descriptions.md` (sidebar tooltips for those five agents). When tweaking any of those five `purpose` strings, keep the cross-document phrasing aligned — the tool-choice guidance appears in five places and divergence between them is exactly the failure mode the rule was added to prevent.

- **Seeded Prompts catalog is now learner-path-sorted — v1.3.2, 2026-05-19** — `Tlamatini/agent/migrations/0002_populate_db.py` was reordered into 10 explicit tiers (context-only Q&A → metrics → files-search → shell → code-gen → vision → specialized → agent control → Unrealer → Multi-Turn / ACPX); the docstring at the top of `populate_initial_values` is the authoritative map of which idPrompt range each migration owns (0002 owns 1-20 and 26-28; 0062 / 0063 own 21-24; 0087 owns 25; 0072 / 0073 / 0074 own 29-48). When seeding a new demo prompt, pick the range that matches the tier and add a comment line in the migration's docstring; do NOT just append to the highest idPrompt because the dropdown is rendered in idPrompt order.

- **Planner statelessness on short follow-ups** — Solved by passing `chat_history_text` into the planner and boosting capability scores. If you touch `_select_planner_tool_names()` or `build_global_execution_plan()`, preserve this argument.
- **Wrapped chat-agent dedup** — `MultiTurnToolAgentExecutor` hashes `tool_name + sorted-JSON args` into `_wrapped_agent_signatures` and short-circuits duplicates with a `ToolMessage` explaining the skip. Do not remove this without replacing it; the LLM reliably launches the same sub-agent twice otherwise.
- **Googler Playwright + async loop** — `sync_playwright()` raises `NotImplementedError` inside Django Channels' running asyncio loop. The Googler tool wraps its Playwright work in a `ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=1)` with a 120s timeout. Any new sync-Playwright tool must do the same.
- **Cancel/rebuild race** — `consumers.py` now `await`s `setup_rag_chain()` during cancel-current instead of `asyncio.create_task(...)`. Otherwise the client receives `MSG_LLM_REESTABLISHED` while the httpx client is still torn down, and the next request hits "Cannot send a request, as the client has been closed." All `getHttpxClientInstance()` callers must also guard against `None`.
- **Exec-report persistence ordering** — In `services/response_parser.py::process_llm_response()`, `save_message(bot_user, llm_response, ...)` must run AFTER the exec-report HTML is appended to `llm_response`, otherwise the tables live only in the broadcast and vanish from chat history on page reload. An earlier revision saved the message before the append step; the fix (commit `e99d2b8`) reorders the operations to: classify → append exec-report HTML → save → broadcast. See the "Exec Report" pipeline step 9 in `docs/claude/exec-report.md` for the full contract. Do not reorder these steps.
- **ACP canvas DOM split (`#canvas-content` vs `#submonitor-container`)** — The ACP canvas is scrollable (commit `9249349`). `#submonitor-container` is the viewport with scrollbars; `#canvas-content` is the content layer where items, the SVG connections layer, and the rubber-band selection box live. All coordinate math (`createCanvasItem`, `makeDraggable`, `startSelectionBox`, `getCenter`, tempPath drawing in `initCanvasEvents`) must use `canvasContent.getBoundingClientRect()`, which already reflects scroll offset — do NOT add `submonitor.scrollLeft/scrollTop` manually, and do NOT append new items to `submonitor`. Item positions are clamped `>= 0` only; the canvas grows to the right/bottom via `updateCanvasContentSize()` in `acp-globals.js`, which must be called after item creation, drag end, .flw load, and undo/redo restoration. Full contract in "ACP Canvas DOM Contract" section of `docs/claude/frontend.md`.

- **ACPX `oneshot-prompt` is the only path that captures TUI agents on Windows** — `claude`, `gemini`, `cursor`, `qwen`, and `codex` are all configured with `transport="oneshot-prompt"` in `agent/acpx/agent_registry.py::DEFAULT_ACP_AGENTS`. They were previously `json-acp` (claude/codex) or `tui-repl` (the others), and the transcript only contained the OUTBOUND prompt — the answer was lost because TUI CLIs detect a piped stdout and refuse to flush. The fix re-spawns the CLI fresh per turn with the prompt as a CLI argument behind `prompt_arg_flag` (`-p` for claude/cursor/gemini/qwen) or `prompt_subcommand_args` (`["exec"]` for codex), closes stdin immediately, and captures stdout to EOF via `proc.communicate(timeout=180)`. Inter-turn session state inside the child does NOT persist (each turn is a brand-new process) — caller must include prior context in the next prompt if continuity is required. Implementation: `AcpSession._oneshot_send_turn` in `agent/acpx/runtime.py` and the mirrored `run_oneshot_prompt` in `agent/agents/acpxer/acpxer.py` (the canvas counterpart). DO NOT revert these to long-lived stdin-fed children; the only thing you'll capture is the outbound prompt, and the user will report responses like "the transcript only shows the outbound prompts, not the inbound responses." Coverage: `OneshotPromptCaptureTests` in `agent/acpx/tests.py` (4 tests) plus `AgentRegistryTransportProfileTests.test_oneshot_prompt_agents_have_capture_path` pin the contract.

- **ACPXer self-contained (do NOT import `agent.acpx.runtime` in pool agents)** — The ACPXer workflow agent (`agent/agents/acpxer/acpxer.py`) is a visual-canvas counterpart of the 12 LLM-facing `acp_*` tools, BUT it does not — and must not — import from `agent.acpx`. Workflow agents in the pool run as separate Python subprocesses started via the user's system Python (or a bundled python.exe in frozen builds); they have no `sys.path` back into the Django app, so `from agent.acpx import AcpxRuntime` would `ModuleNotFoundError`. The agent therefore mirrors the runtime's transport-aware drain (4 completion rules: `done:true` envelope / child exit / hard timeout / transport-aware idle), the `agent_id` registry (claude/codex/tlamatini = json-acp, gemini/cursor/qwen/etc = tui-repl), and the NDJSON transcript format inline in ~120 lines. The transcript format is byte-identical to what `agent.acpx.runtime.AcpSession.send_turn` writes, so transcripts produced by ACPXer are interchangeable with those produced by `acp_spawn`. If you ever consolidate the two implementations into a shared package, the package must NOT live under `agent.*` — extract it to a top-level path that's importable from a fresh subprocess (or vendor it as a wheel that ships with the agent pool).
- **ACPX toolbar toggle filters the entire ACPX/Skill tool surface per-request — and now defaults to OFF** — `agent/acpx/__init__.py` exposes `ACPX_TOOL_NAMES` (the 12 LLM-facing ACPX/Skill tool names) and `filter_acpx_tools(tools, acpx_enabled)`. The chat toolbar's third checkbox (`#acpx-enabled` in `templates/agent/agent_page.html`) **starts unchecked** on a fresh session — JS hydration in `agent_page_state.js::applyStoredAcpxState` falls back to `false` when sessionStorage has no prior value — and every backend read site defaults `acpx_enabled` to `False` (`rag/interface.py::ask_rag` for both dict and raw-string payloads, `rag/factory.py`, `rag/chains/unified.py` payload-rebuild whitelist in three places, `mcp_agent.py::CapabilityAwareToolAgentExecutor.invoke`, and `consumers.py::receive` plus the `queue_llm_retrieval` signature). When the user explicitly ticks the box the planner / executor get the ACPX/Skill tools; otherwise those tool names are filtered out. **Do NOT remove the `acpx_enabled` key from `UnifiedAgentChain.invoke`'s payload-rebuild whitelist** in `rag/chains/unified.py` — it lives next to `multi_turn_enabled` and `exec_report_enabled` and the same drop-on-rebuild bug class applies. When the flag is unticked, `bypass_prompt_validation` is computed as `multi_turn_enabled OR acpx_enabled`, which means a request with neither flag set still goes through the normal prompt-shape validator.

- **Summarizer one-shot mode (`input_text` + `target_words`)** — `agent/agents/summarizer/summarizer.py` now accepts a one-shot path: when `input_text` is non-empty AND `source_agents` is empty, the agent skips the polling loop entirely, sends `input_text` directly to the LLM, emits exactly one `INI_SECTION_SUMMARIZER<<<` block (so Parametrizer / Exec Report consume the result the same way they consume a polling-mode summary), and triggers `target_agents` whenever the summary is non-empty. The chat tool `chat_agent_summarize_text` (registered in `chat_agent_registry.py`, `template_dir="summarizer"`) is the canonical caller — its `example_request` is `input_text='<full text>' and target_words=40`. Pre-existing canvas behavior (polling `source_agents` for `[EVENT_TRIGGERED]`) is unchanged when `input_text` is left at its default empty string. Coverage: the agent's own log shows `One-shot input_text length: <N> chars; target_words=<M>` so a quick grep of `summarizer_<n>.log` confirms which path fired.

- **`setup-new-acpx-key` skill is the canonical key-injection path** — When the user wants to plug a new credential into an ACPX `agent_id` (claude/codex/cursor/gemini/qwen/...), prefer `invoke_skill('setup-new-acpx-key', {...})` over hand-editing config.json. The skill's SKILL.md (`agent/skills_pkg/setup_new_acpx_key/SKILL.md`) is the single source of truth for the canonical env-var map (claude → `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, gemini → `GEMINI_API_KEY` + `GOOGLE_API_KEY` alias, codex → `OPENAI_API_KEY`, qwen → `DASHSCOPE_API_KEY`) and the two-layer config.json wiring (top-level for callers like `image_interpreter.py` / `opus_client.py`; `acpx.agents.<id>.env` for the spawned child). The merge order is `{**os.environ, **spec.env}`, so explicit `acpx.agents.<id>.env` wins over an exported shell variable. The skill also patches `regen_secrets.py` when introducing a brand-new key, keeping the push-able / keyed toggle accurate.

- **`regen_secrets.py` is a two-mode scrubber/restorer for config.json** — `python regen_secrets.py --mode push-able` rewrites real secrets in `Tlamatini/agent/config.json` (top-level `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` / `GEMINI_API_KEY` / `OLLAMA_TOKEN` and the `acpx.agents.<id>.env` blocks) into placeholders like `<ANTHROPIC_API_KEY goes here>` so the file is safe to commit. `--mode keyed` restores the values from `data.keys` (gitignored, `KEY=VALUE` format) so the local working tree stays usable. The same script is the splat target after editing `data.keys`. **Never commit `data.keys`** — line 265 of `.gitignore` already excludes it but a `git add -A` could accidentally stage it from a fresh checkout if the line drifts; verify with `git status` before pushing.

- **Keyboarder + Shoter usable from Multi-Turn (`chat_agent_keyboarder` / `chat_agent_shoter`)** — Both desktop-UI agents are wrapped chat-agent tools. Shoter (`chat_agent_shoter`) was already registered (read-only screenshot capture). Keyboarder (`chat_agent_keyboarder`) is now wrapped too — it accepts `input_sequence` (literal text in single/double quotes; key names and `+`-joined chords go bare; comma-separated tokens) and `stride_delay` (ms between strokes), exactly mirroring `agents/keyboarder/config.yaml`. This unblocks the canonical "open notepad → verify → type into it" flow: `execute_command(notepad)` → `chat_agent_shoter` (+ optional `chat_agent_image_interpreter` to confirm the window is ready) → `chat_agent_keyboarder` to type. Keyboarder is state-changing (keystrokes target the foreground window), so it lives in `_EXEC_REPORT_TOOLS` under `agent_key="keyboarder"` with its own caption gradient (`#F44336 → #FF9800 → #FFEB3B → #4CAF50`, mirroring `.canvas-item.keyboarder-agent`). Shoter remains read-only and stays out of the report on purpose. **Tool row** is seeded by migration `0078_add_chat_agent_keyboarder_tool.py` (description `Chat-Agent-Keyboarder`); without that row the registry's `_tool_status_key()` lookup falls back to "enabled" so the tool still binds, but the Tools dialog cannot toggle it. Quirk: pyautogui hotkey names — Keyboarder normalizes via `get_pyautogui_key()` (`escape→esc`, `windows→win`, `altgr→altright`, `mayus/caps→capslock`); pass `'win+r'`, `'ctrl+alt+t'`, etc. lowercase.

- **Wrapped-agent assignment parser must split on `and`/`with`, not just `,`/`;`** — Every `example_request` string in `chat_agent_registry.py` separates parameters with the natural-language conjunction `and` (occasionally `with`): `filepath='X' and content='Y'`, `url='X' with system_prompt='Y' and content_mode='Z'`. The LLM reliably copies that style. Before the fix, `_split_assignment_segments` only split on `,` and `;`, and `_closes_outer_quote` only closed a single-line quote on `,`/`;`/EOF — so multi-arg calls collapsed into one swollen segment whose first value absorbed the entire tail (`file_path='X' and content='Y'` → file_path became `X' and content='Y`). Evidence: six consecutive `file_creator_00N` runs with paths like `C:\Development\AngysBackInCUDA\drone_knap.h' and content='/*...`, each failing with WinError 123 and one leaving a literal directory named `drone_knapsack.h' and content='`. The fix (in `agent/tools.py`) adds a `_looks_like_conjunction_assignment_start(text, pos)` helper matching `(and|with) <ident>=`, and plugs it into both `_closes_outer_quote` (as an additional closer in both single-line AND multi-line mode) and `_split_assignment_segments` (as a top-level segment boundary whenever a whitespace char outside quotes/brackets is followed by the conjunction pattern). Coverage: the new `AssignmentParserRobustnessTests.test_and_conjunction_splits_file_creator_pair`, `test_with_conjunction_also_splits`, `test_parametric_file_creator_example_request_parses`, and the sweep `test_no_registry_example_leaks_conjunction_into_a_value` pin the contract — the sweep scans every `WRAPPED_CHAT_AGENT_SPECS` example and fails if any resulting value contains a leaked conjunction pattern. Do NOT narrow the close-heuristic back to `,;EOF` only — it will silently re-break every multi-arg wrapped chat-agent call.

- **Flow Compiler + Agent Contracts (commit `0bea21d`, May 2026) are the single backend pipeline both Save/Validate/Start AND Chat Create-Flow now go through** — `agent/services/agent_contracts.py` (the `AgentContract` registry: connection-field shape per slot, `parametrizer_fields`, `secret_paths`, `singleton`/`long_running`/`never_starts_targets`/`exclude_from_validation` flags), `agent/services/agent_paths.py` (frozen/source-aware pool resolution + canvas-id normalization — strips `(2)` cardinals, hyphenates spaces, collapses any `[^A-Za-z0-9_]` into underscores), `agent/services/flow_spec.py` (`FlowSpec` / `FlowNode` / `FlowConnection` dataclasses + `normalize_flow_payload()` / `flow_spec_to_legacy_json(redact=True)`), and `agent/services/flow_compiler.py` (`compile_flow_spec` / `compile_flow_payload` / `list_pool_agents_for_validation`) jointly own the pipeline. New endpoints: `POST /agent/compile_flow/` (called from `acp-flow-snapshot.js::compileCurrentACPFlow` with `mode='write'` from Start and `mode='dry_run'` from Validate), `POST /agent/flow_from_tool_calls/` (called from `agent_page_chat.js::_normalizeChatFlowBeforeDownload` so the Create-Flow download is a backend-redacted, registry-canonical `.flw`), and `GET /agent/agent_contracts/` (returns `list_contract_summaries()` for diagnostics). **Do NOT bypass the contracts**: the legacy `os.listdir` loop in `views.compile_flow_view`'s ancestor was deleted in favor of `list_pool_agents_for_validation()` precisely so a future agent type cannot drift between Validate's allow-list and Compile's known-types. **Do NOT hand-edit `_BUILTIN_CONTRACTS` for an agent that the disk-discovery pass would already cover** — the discovery pass infers `output_field_by_slot={0: "output_agents"}` automatically when `target_agents` is absent from the template, infers `never_starts_targets` from `_NEVER_START_TARGETS`, and merges `_PARAMETRIZER_OUTPUT_FIELDS` even on top of builtins. Add a builtin only when an agent has slot-2/slot-3 quirks (Forker/Asker/Counter/AND/OR), is a singleton (FlowCreator/FlowHypervisor), is `excluded_from_validation`, or has a non-trivial `secret_paths` list. Coverage: `agent/test_flow_contracts.py` pins the source-mode agents-root resolution, alias normalization, the Ender kill-list contract, and the Parametrizer-mappings-as-CSV-artifact behavior. The `_compiled_configs()` step **clears** all known connection fields before re-writing so a stale wiring left over from a previous compile cannot resurrect.

- **`agents_descriptions.md` is the authoritative source for sidebar tooltips and canvas Description dialogs (commit `88dd99b`, May 2026)** — `Tlamatini/agent/views.py::_load_agent_purpose_map()` resolves descriptions via `_resolve_agent_descriptions_search_paths()`, which probes `agents_descriptions.md` first (next to `manage.py` in source mode, next to `sys.executable` in frozen mode) and falls back to `README.md` only if `agents_descriptions.md` is absent or yields zero rows. The parser is `_parse_agent_purpose_map(lines)` — it scans every `## Workflow Agents` table for rows of shape `| **Name** | <description> |` and keys them by `re.sub(r'[^a-z0-9]+', '', name.lower())`. The legacy alias `_load_agent_purpose_map_from_readme = _load_agent_purpose_map` is preserved so any out-of-tree caller (dev script, scheduled remote agent) keeps working. **Build implication**: `build.py` now lists `Path("agents_descriptions.md"): dist_manage / "agents_descriptions.md"` in `required_file_copies` next to `README.md` — drop that line and frozen builds revert to README-only descriptions, which works but is fragile because the long-form README sections evolve faster than the descriptions table. **UI implication**: `acp-canvas-core.js::showAgentPurposeTooltip` and `contextual_menus.js::openDescriptionDialog` were updated to fall back to "No description was found for this agent in agents_descriptions.md." (was: "in README.md."). Editing a row's `Description` cell in `agents_descriptions.md` changes both the human docs AND the live UI text — there is no other source of truth. Coverage: `agent/tests.py::AgentPurposeMapResolutionTests` pins the resolution-order behavior end-to-end.

- **TeleTlamatini now bridges the full three-flag toolbar surface (commit `1287e56`, May 2026)** — Each Telegram message TeleTlamatini forwards to Tlamatini carries `multi_turn_enabled`, `exec_report_enabled`, AND `acpx_enabled` verbatim, so a Telegram user gets exactly the operational surface that a browser user with all three checkboxes ticked would. Resolver-level default for `acpx_enabled` is `False` (matches the chat toolbar's system-wide default and keeps pre-change deploys behaving as before), but the **shipped `config.yaml` sets `acpx_enabled: true`** so a fresh install can drive the full ACPX scheme out of the box. WhatsTlamatini was later retired; WhatsApp send/receive now belongs to **Whatsapper**, while **TeleTlamatini** remains the only current long-running remote full-chat bridge. **Don't pin `acpx_enabled: true` in the resolver default** — the `config.yaml` is the user-facing knob and the resolver default is the legacy-deploy backstop; flipping the resolver would make every old TeleTlamatini deploy silently start exposing the ACPX tool surface on its first restart.

- **`SuppressHttpGet200` logging filter generalizes the runtime-poller silencer (commit `8bb4047`, May 2026)** — `Tlamatini/tlamatini/logging_filters.py::SuppressHttpGet200` (was `SuppressRuntimePollerOk`, hard-coded to `/agent/check_chat_runtimes_status/`) now drops the daphne access log line for **any** HTTP GET that returned a 200, while keeping every non-GET request, every redirect (3xx), and every error (4xx/5xx) visible. Settings entry was renamed `suppress_http_get_200` and rebound to `django.channels.server`. Net effect: the unified `tlamatini.log` is near-zero-noise during normal operation (the runtime poller, every static-file fetch, every WebSocket-handshake-as-GET — all silenced) but a real failure still surfaces because non-200s pass through. **Do NOT narrow it back to a path-based match** — the explicit goal of the rename was that adding a new GET endpoint never re-introduces noise; do NOT extend it to drop POST/PUT/DELETE either, because state-changing requests are the ones an oncall reader most needs to see in the log.

- **Whatsapper vs WhatsTlamatini are different agents — keep them straight** — At the 2026-06-22 consolidation, `Whatsapper` became the short-lived official Meta Cloud action/notification agent and `WhatsTlamatini` was retired. **Current behavior supersedes the old "Cloud only" wording:** Whatsapper still defaults to the official business Cloud API, but an explicitly selected `provider=web` / `me` now sends from the operator's own personal account through unofficial WhatsApp Web automation with a one-time QR login and account-ban risk. TeleTlamatini remains the only remote full-chat bridge. TextMeBot/Twilio remain absent, providers must never be switched silently, and older "no WhatsApp Web" prose is historical rather than current guidance.

- **ACPX-Skills navbar dropdown (2026-05-17) — DB stays at "enumeration + enable/disable", disk is source of truth** — A new **ACPX-Skills** dropdown lives between **Agents** and **Config** in the chat navbar (`agent/templates/agent/agent_page.html`). Four entries: **Browse Skills** (`GET /agent/skills/` + `/agent/skills/<name>/`), **Configure Skills** (WebSocket `set-skills`, mirrors `set-mcps` / `set-agents`), **Diagnostics** (`GET /agent/skills/_/diagnostics/`), **Reload Registry** (`POST /agent/skills/_/reload/`). The `Skill` DB model already existed from migration `0071_acpx_skills.py` and is auto-seeded by `boot_skills()` on a background thread from `apps.AgentConfig.ready()` — only the UI + HTTP endpoints + WebSocket wiring + tool-surface gating in `agent/acpx/tools.py` were missing. **Key constraint**: `save_skill(name, enabled)` only touches `Skill.enabled`; the cached fields (`description`, `runtime`, `acpx_agent`, `frontmatter_json`, `body_sha256`) are owned by `boot_skills()` and are intentionally NOT user-configurable. Browse / Diagnostics read fresh from `agent.skills.registry.skill_registry` — SKILL.md on disk is the only source of truth for permissions, budgets, body. **Tool-surface gating** is via `_disabled_skill_names()` in `agent/acpx/tools.py`: when `Skill.enabled = False`, `list_skills` filters the row out and `invoke_skill` returns `{"ok":false,"code":"SKILL_DISABLED"}`. Fails OPEN on DB exception so a broken admin layer never silently hides skills. **WebSocket parity** with Mcps/Tools/Agents: `consumers.skill_establishment()` sends `type:'skill'` system messages on connect; frontend pushes them into the module-level `skills = []` array (`agent_page_state.js`); Configure dialog reads from there and sends `set-skills` on Continue with the `name=description=true/false,...` shape. **Skill names key directly** (no `skill-N` prefix unlike `mcp-N` / `tool-N`) because `Skill.name` is the SKILL.md frontmatter `name` and is already unique. Coverage: 14 tests in 3 classes (`SkillsAdminEndpointTests`, `SkillsToolSurfaceGatingTests`, `SkillsNavbarTemplateContractTests`). **Do NOT** add granular skill config (permission overrides, budget overrides, per-user toggles) to the DB — the user-stated constraint is "DB only for enumeration and enable/disable like MCPs/Agents". If those features are ever needed, put them in `config.json` or a separate sidecar table.
