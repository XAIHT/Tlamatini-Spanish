# Overlap-Safe PPTX Dossier

Use this skill when a deck must be complete, polished, and layout-safe.

## Non-Negotiable Layout Rules

- Never cram dense content onto one slide. Split into more slides.
- Track every intentional content rectangle: title, subtitle, panels, cards, diagrams, tables, images, and tree text.
- Validate that every tracked rectangle stays within slide bounds.
- Validate that tracked rectangles do not overlap unless the overlap is deliberate containment, such as text inside its own card.
- Use `TextFrame.fit_text()` or conservative font sizes, but do not rely on auto-fit to rescue overloaded slides.
- For file-tree appendix slides, chunk the tree into small fixed-size line groups; keep one monospaced text box per slide.
- For tables, prefer monospaced text or pre-sized rows over huge PowerPoint tables.

## Visual Style Guidance

When the user supplies a reference presentation:

- Inspect the deck with `python-pptx`; if slides are image-only, extract media from `ppt/media/` and use the images as style references or cover backgrounds.
- Match the visual language rather than copying old content blindly.
- For the Tlamatini reference style, prefer obsidian/dark stone backgrounds, copper and jade accents, thin ornamental lines, translucent cards, geometric diagrams, and light display typography.
- Use icons as simple labeled glyphs, line shapes, or small cards when assets are not available.
- Keep contrast high enough for extracted text and projected viewing.

## Required Deck Content

The deck must include:

- What the system is and what it does.
- How the system works end to end.
- How to use it from source, in chat, in Multi-Turn mode, and in the workflow designer.
- Packaging/build path.
- Agent catalog overview.
- Repository facts and current HEAD.
- Effective line counts by language, total effective lines, and methodology.
- Largest files by effective lines.
- Complete tracked file tree, split across appendix slides.
- Latest changes or optimizations as a section, not as the whole deck.

## Preferred Tlamatini Workflow

In the Tlamatini repo, run:

```powershell
python Tlamatini\agent\doc_generation\refresh_project_docs.py
```

The generator builds the full PPTX and performs an internal geometry audit while building slides. If it fails, fix layout by adding slides, shortening bullet groups, or reducing line chunks. Do not ignore audit failures.

## Mandatory Three-Pass Consistency Sweep

1. **Discover:** compare the previous deck commit with local HEAD/version tag; inventory tracked files, agents, tools, skills, languages, JavaScript/CSS assets, README, BookOfTlamatini, prompts, and recent implementation commits.
2. **Reconcile:** map each current release behavior to source plus documentation and update active counts from source. Preserve dated historical material, but never let it drive the cover, facts, architecture, usage, or current-release slides.
3. **Prove:** repeat stale-version/count searches, lint/test, regenerate, extract slide text, prove complete-tree parity, run geometry checks, and render every slide for visual inspection.

For the v1.48.17 release and later, include Grepper's multi-encoding search, the guarded five-class Exec Report vocabulary, Kuberneter's canonical result fields, `Uninstaller.exe` preservation, source-derived public/private build checks, the standardized Escape-closes-every-dialog policy with its sealed-updater exception, the themed `tlmAlert`/`tlmConfirm` popups, and the frozen-bundle carriage proof. Retain the v1.48.14 private External-MCP runtime flow, ten supervisors, inactive defaults, catalog tombstones, persistent Memory state, secret-separated builds, nested-diagram repair, and explicit "proposal, not shipped behavior" updater label, plus the v1.48.13 placement/dialog/logging foundations.

For the v1.50.0s release and later, include separate, readable slides for NetSpeed-Calculator and its metered-bandwidth warning; WAL-safe SQLite backup/set/hot-swap; Googler's structured dork compiler, syntax/preset contract, `links_only` file workflow, and responsible-use boundary; a separate Googler resilience slide covering four plain-HTTP server-rendered routes before browser launch, visible installed Chrome, bundled-browser fallback, seven browser routes, explicit-engine Tier-0 bypass, bounded retries, answer attribution, and Google-only advanced operators; the External MCP Adder lifecycle; Deep Internet Research prompt; Ollama Pro-or-higher setup; private contact synchronization/public PII exclusion; and the source-derived 88/66/108/29/197 counts. Show the annotated `v1.50.0s` tag commit separately from a later `HEAD` when needed. Split these topics rather than shrinking type or allowing dense panels to overlap.

## Validation Checklist

- If Python source code was generated or modified, run `python -m ruff check` from the project root and fix all reported issues.
- Open the PPTX with `python-pptx` and confirm slide count.
- Extract text from the first content slides and at least one tree appendix slide.
- Confirm the line-inventory slide contains the total effective line count.
- Confirm the tree appendix count covers the complete tracked file tree.
- Confirm no audit exceptions were raised during generation.
- When Microsoft PowerPoint is available, render every slide through native PowerPoint and inspect text bounds, out-of-bounds shapes, and unintended text-to-text intersections.
