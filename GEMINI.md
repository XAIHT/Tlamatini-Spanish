# GEMINI.md — Complete Tlamatini System Knowledge Base & Onboarding Reference

> **Welcome, Gemini!** This is the definitive onboarding document and reference manual for working on the **Tlamatini** project. Read this file in full before performing any coding tasks. It combines architecture details, tool behaviors, visual agent catalogs, security policies, and Windows-specific design patterns gathered from across the codebase.

# ⛔ PRIVATE DATA GUARD — ABSOLUTE, NON-NEGOTIABLE ⛔

**NEVER REWRITE GIT HISTORY. EVER. IN THIS REPO, FOR ANY REASON.**

- **NO** `rebase`, `commit --amend`, `reset --hard` to drop commits, `filter-branch`, `git filter-repo`, BFG, or history-rewriting tools.
- **NO** `push --force` / `--force-with-lease`, **NO** deleting pushed tags, and **NO** deleting remote branches/refs.
- **TO REMOVE SENSITIVE/PRIVATE DATA**: Edit or delete the file, then make a **NEW FORWARD COMMIT** and push that. The past commits MUST stay untouched.
- **TRUTHFUL HISTORY**: Git logs, tags, and commit lines must always remain intact and completely truthful.
- This policy is enforced by `test_private_data_guard.py` (automated tests) and a global hooks script that runs in the developer environment.

---

## 1. Project Identity, Persona & Communication Rules

### 1.1 The User: Angela López Mendoza
- The user is **Angela López Mendoza** — the developer, architect, and creator of Tlamatini.
- **ALWAYS address her by name ("Angela") in your responses.** Do not speak to her impersonally. Open or weave "Angela" into your replies.
- Use her full name **"Angela López Mendoza"** when affirming her as the creator of Tlamatini.
- Her name must **NEVER** be erased/scrubbed from the source files, banners, docs, prompts, About window, PDF/PPTX, or build metadata. Only a public release build may mask her other private data (emails/phones), never her name.

### 1.2 Persona & Identity
- Tlamatini (Nahuatl for "one who knows") is **explicitly female** by design.
- The `talker` (Text-to-Speech) agent is restricted to **female voices only** (`tara`, `leah`, `jess`, `mia`, `zoe`).
- The internal voice resolver `resolve_voice()` in `agent/agents/talker/talker.py` enforces this. If a male voice is requested, it throws `MaleVoiceForbiddenError` and exits the agent with a hard error: `"NOW CLOSING.. BYE"`. Do NOT modify or bypass this constraint.

### 1.3 How to talk to Angela (Mandatory Rules)
- **Answer short and in plain language.**
- **Lead with the single key fact in bold.**
- Use a few short numbered points at most. Use everyday words, **no jargon**, **no giant multi-section walls of text**, and **no long source lists**.
- Cut anything that does not change her decision.
- End with **one direct question or next step**.

### 1.4 Step-by-Step Interactive Mode
When solving a problem that needs Angela to do things on her machine (Rethinking configs, clicking browser/UI, checking board output, restarting the app):
- **Go one step at a time**:
  1. Give **exactly one** concrete step.
  2. Give her the **exact string to send back** — a token carrying what she sees (e.g. `step1: I see ___`).
  3. **WAIT**. Only when she sends that string do you give the next step.
  4. Repeat — one step + one reply-string per turn.

### 1.5 Current Release (`v1.50.2s` — Spanish edition)
- **`v1.50.2s` is the current package/documentation release for this Spanish edition**; the newest annotated tag actually in THIS tree is `v1.50.2s` (`185c736e`). Runtime identity stays git-tag-derived. The trailing **`s` is the edition letter** — kept in every human-readable surface, stripped wherever a version becomes numbers (`agent/version.py::strip_edition_suffix`); see `VERSIONING.md` → *The Spanish edition letter*. Do not quote the English tree's commit hashes: they do not exist in this repository.
- Historical lineage carried forward: Same-day lineage: `v1.48.15` = encoding-safe Grepper + closed verdict vocabulary, `v1.48.16` = themed popups + frozen-bundle carriage proof, `v1.48.17` = the Escape dismissal standardization and the sealed updater.
- Grepper uses a BOM-first decoder for UTF-8/16/32 and then cp1252/Latin-1, so Windows PowerShell logs and accented Spanish source are searchable while genuine binary files remain skipped. Keep the BOM test ahead of the NUL test — UTF-16/32 text is legitimately full of `0x00`.
- **Escape now dismisses EVERY dialog on both pages and means exactly what the titlebar ✕ means; an outside click still never dismisses.** A bubble-phase dispatcher activates each dialog's own dismiss control, so Ask-Execs still answers Deny, confirms resolve `false`, scroll locks release, and a sealed updater still refuses. `closeOnEscape: false` is forbidden tree-wide. The ONE exception is a dialog holding `el.tlmSealKey` (the updater while downloading), whose seal is checked before every other dismissal path.
- The last native `alert()` / `confirm()` calls became themed **`tlmAlert` / `tlmConfirm`** (Promise-based, `.tlmpop-*`, overlay z-index 100001, fail-open). They are intentionally not jQuery-UI dialogs, because they are raised by native modals at z-index 20000 while `.ui-front` is ~100.
- **`build.py` proves its own payload.** Modules reached only through fail-open imports cannot report their own absence, so `verify_frozen_agent_modules()` opens the archive PyInstaller just produced and aborts unless all seven `_FROZEN_REQUIRED_AGENT_MODULES` are inside it. The PYZ is an entry inside the executable's CArchive, not a loose `_internal/PYZ-00.pyz`.
- `agent_verdict.py` has five disjoint status classes plus `KNOWN_STATUSES`; `test_status_vocabulary.py` statically guards every pool-agent token. Degraded deliverables are red, named intact completions are green, and unknown tokens fail open but are reported as `R8b.unknown_status`.
- Kuberneter publishes numeric `returncode`, boolean `success`, and tokenized `status: ok|failed`; never put an exit-code expression in `status:`.
- Self-update preserves the separately built `Uninstaller.exe`. Public builders clear private External-MCP catalog opt-in; only the explicit keyed/private builder may supply it.
- Source-verified active surface: 87 workflow agents, 65 wrapped chat agents, 107 built-in Multi-Turn tools, 28 runtime skills, 194 migrations, and 37 JavaScript modules.

---

## 2. Strict Casing & Naming Conventions

The single source of truth for any visual workflow agent display name is `agent/services/agent_paths.py::display_name_from_agent_type`, because startup rebuilds the `Agent` table from the `agents/` directory. The migration row, `chat_agent_registry.display_name`, and JavaScript class map must stay aligned with that canonical resolver. If casing or hyphenation drifts, the canvas connection or Configure-Agents gate can fail silently.

| Context | Case Convention | Example (STM32er) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Display Name (DB)** | Exact Case (as designed) | `STM32er` (NEVER `Stm32er` or `STM32Er`) |
| **Database `agentName`** | Lowercase / Hyphen | `stm32er` |
| **Agent Folder** | Lowercase / Underscore | `agent/agents/stm32er/` |
| **Agent script** | Lowercase / Underscore | `agents/stm32er/stm32er.py` |
| **JS classMap key** | Lowercase / Hyphen | `'stm32er'` |
| **CSS selector** | Lowercase / Hyphen | `.canvas-item.stm32er-agent` |
| **Connector symbol** | PascalCase-ish | `updateStm32erConnection` |
| **Token block (Logs)** | ALL-CAPS | `INI_SECTION_STM32ER` / `END_SECTION_STM32ER` |

## 3. The 7-Layer Architecture

Tlamatini consists of seven distinct layers spanning from the database up to the backend workflow compiler and out-of-process multi-agent controllers:

```

- **Layer 1 (Database)**: Seeds default registries. Toggles on the UI enable/disable tools and agents which update database rows.
- **Layer 2 (Runtime Services)**: Started from `apps.py` on Django boot. They feed real-time metrics and file indexes to the app.
- **Layer 3 (Sidecar Chains)**: Prefetch files and system data to inject into the LLM context.
- **Layer 4 (Main Chains)**: Monkey-patched at execution time by `factory.py` to merge context before calling the LLM.
- **Layer 5 (LangChain Tools)**: Bound to the model. Includes direct shell executors (`execute_command`, `execute_file`) and wrapped `chat_agent_*` controllers.
- **Layer 6 (ACPX & Skills)**: Spawns external CLI engines (Claude Code, Qwen, Gemini, etc.) and executes local `SKILL.md` playbooks.
- **Layer 7 (Flow Compiler)**: Normalizes canvas schemas into run-ready pools on disk under `agents/pools/<session_id>/`.

## 3.5 Binary-Content Guard on the Context Loader

`agent/rag/binary_guard.py` screens every file entering the RAG chain by its **bytes** and drops binary content before it is embedded. It complements — does not replace — the name-based **Context ▸ Set file type omissions** list; both run.

- **Cascade (cheapest first, at most ONE 8 KiB read/file):** extension denylist (zero I/O, 192 extensions) → sample → empty → **BOM** → 45 magic signatures → NUL byte → control-byte ratio (`bytes.translate`) → UTF-8 decodability.
- **Hook:** `CustomTextLoader.__init__` raises `ValueError`, swallowed by `DirectoryLoader(silent_errors=True)` — identical to the existing omission path. Wired at **all three** `DirectoryLoader` call sites in `agent/rag/factory.py`.
- **Logging:** `--- [BINARY-GUARD]` lines in `tlamatini.log` name every dropped file + stage + reason, in frozen and source mode alike. Drops are accumulated in a lock-protected recorder (DirectoryLoader runs 12 threads) and printed as one block.
- **Config:** `binary_context_detection` (default `true`), `binary_detection_sample_bytes` / `_control_ratio` / `_log_each_file` / `_extra_binary_extensions` / `_force_text_extensions`.

**Two invariants you must not break:** the guard is **FAIL-OPEN** (any error/uncertainty → load as text; `classify_file()` never raises), and the **BOM stage must precede the NUL stage** (UTF-16 text is full of `0x00`). Coverage: `agent/test_binary_guard.py` (45 tests).

## 4. Multi-Turn Orchestration & the Operator Loop

When **Multi-Turn** is checked in the toolbar, Tlamatini shifts from a "text answering box" to a **stateful runtime operator**:

1. **Planner Gating**: Prompt-shape validation is bypassed. The system constructs a request-scoped plan using the `GlobalExecutionPlanner`.
2. **Full-Surface Binding**: The executor binds **every enabled tool, wrapped agent, and skill** to the LLM. It does NOT restrict the LLM to a small planner subset.
3. **Execution Limits**:
   - **Soft Warning**: Fires if iterations exceed **64**. It injects a warning into the prompt encouraging the LLM to choose cleaner paths.
   - **Hard Stop**: Enforced at **256** iterations. It terminates the loop and forces a final response.
   - **Repetition Breaker**: Detects if the LLM calls the same tool with identical signatures. Polling and management tools (`run_status`, `session_status`, etc.) are explicitly exempt from fingerprinting to avoid tripping this guard during normal wait loops.

### 4.1 Cost Trimming Measures
To avoid ballooning LLM token counts with 107 built-in tools plus dynamic External-MCP remotes:
- **One-line Tool Summaries**: Standard LangChain JSON schemas are fed to the model, but the textual system prompt lists each tool on a single line.
- **Ollama Keep-Alive**: The `ChatOllama` connection is instantiated with `keep_alive: -1` (or from `OLLAMA_KEEP_ALIVE`) so the model context cache is preserved between turns on the Ollama daemon.

### 4.2 Step-by-Step Mode
- Controlled by the `#step-by-step-enabled` checkbox.
- Appends instructions forcing the LLM to execute exactly **one tool call at a time**, return a progress statement, and wait for the user to submit a `READY` input before continuing.

### 4.3 Self-Healing Model Steps (`agent/self_healing.py`, 2026-07-06)
Every model `.invoke()` inside `MultiTurnToolAgentExecutor` is wrapped by a per-request `SelfHealingInvoker`. Its contract is **never hang, never discard work, never lie**:
- **Never hang** — each attempt runs under a per-attempt watchdog (`_run_with_watchdog`, worker thread) of `unified_agent_llm_step_timeout_seconds` (default 80 s): an over-deadline model call is ABANDONED, never awaited. On a transient failure it retries DISTINCT tactics (retry, back-off, message-tail trim, plain-LLM fallback) up to `unified_agent_llm_step_max_tactics` (default 4096). Only the USER (Cancel) or an exhausted ladder stops it, raising `ModelStepUnrecoverable`.
- **Never discard work** — if it fails after ≥1 agent already ran, the executor finishes GRACEFULLY from that real work (`_degraded_answer_from_results`), preserving the Create-Flow button + Exec report. Only a pure-Q&A re-raises, and `rag/chains/unified.py::_invoke_unified_agent_with_retry` short-circuits it straight to the fallback.
- **Never lie** — `recovery_preamble(recovery_events)` is prepended to the final persisted answer on every exit path, and `consumers.py` streams live retry status to the user's chat (`register_status_broadcaster`, per Multi-Turn request, independent of Ask-Execs).

---

## 5. Human-in-the-Loop: "Ask Execs" Gating

The **Ask Execs** gate runs inside the worker thread of the Multi-Turn executor (`MultiTurnToolAgentExecutor` in `agent/mcp_agent.py`):

```
[Unified Agent Loop] 
         │
         ▼
State-Changing Tool Call? ───(No)───► Execute Tool
         │ (Yes)
         ▼
Is Ask Execs Checked? ───(No)───► Execute Tool
         │ (Yes)
         ▼
[ExecPermissionBroker]
  - Register request UUID
  - Emit WS 'exec_permission_request' to browser
  - Thread Blocks on threading.Event()
         │
         ▼ (User responds in browser modal)
[WebSocket Receive]
  - Resolves broker event with 'Proceed' or 'Deny'
         │
         ├───► Proceed ──► Unblocks Thread ──► Execute Tool
         │
         └───► Deny ──► Unblocks Thread ──► Record Interrupted State ──► Halt Chain
```

- **Exemptions**: Read-only, polling, and status tools (`execute_netstat`, `chat_agent_run_status`, `acp_list_sessions`, etc.) are marked in `_requires_exec_permission()` and never block.
- **Fail-Safe**: If a browser session disconnects, the broker is closed, or a WebSocket error occurs, the permission defaults to **Deny**.
- **Deny Behavior**: Halts the entire execution. The backend sets `last_exec_report_denied = True`. The frontend appends a red `"Execution interrupted"` banner to the message output.

---

## 6. The Universal External-MCP Client

Tlamatini features a universal, config-driven MCP client managed by `agent/external_mcp_manager.py`:

- **Decoupled Lifecycle**: MCP server connections are established in a **background thread, off the main chat path**. A slow, failing, or offline server will never freeze the chat page.
- **Config file**: Lives at `agent/external_mcps.json` next to `config.json` in the `mcpServers` format. It is preserved user state and a sanitized tracked build input; never commit a keyed/private copy.
- **Entitlements**: Allows up to **5 active servers** at a time.
- **Transports**:
  - `stdio`: Spawns a local executable (e.g. `npx`, `uvx`, `python`, `docker run`).
  - `streamable-http`: Modern HTTP endpoint.
  - `sse`: Legacy server-sent events.
  - `websocket`: Standard WebSockets.
- **LLM Supervisor Tools**: The LLM manages imports, runtimes, and activations using 10 dedicated tools:
  - `external_mcp_status`, `external_mcp_reconnect`, `external_mcp_doctor`, `external_mcp_runtime_status`, `external_mcp_runtime_install`, `external_mcp_list_tools`, `external_mcp_call`, `external_mcp_import`, `external_mcp_set_active`, and `external_mcp_wait`.
- **Private runtime**: `runtime_provisioner.py` can install missing Node/npm/npx/pnpm and uv/uvx under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Tlamatini\runtimes`, with no administrator rights or system-PATH mutation. Startup and connection paths remain fail-open and non-blocking.
- **Shipped defaults**: `external_mcp_defaults.py` seeds official `memory` and `sequential-thinking` entries, both inactive. Edits are preserved, deletes are tombstoned, and Memory persists under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Tlamatini\memory\memory.json`.
- **Release separation**: Public builds contain only the two secret-free defaults and abort on live-looking credentials; private/keyed builds may contain the maintainer catalog.
- **MCP Doctor (Agent #78)**: A static triage node that inspects server configurations (validates executable paths, detects missing environment tokens or placeholder secrets) **without establishing a live socket connection**.

---

## 7. ACPX CLI Runtime & Skills System

**ACPX** manages the integration of external coding-agent CLIs (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Gemini, Qwen, etc.) running as out-of-process subprocesses.

### 7.1 Transport Modes
- `oneshot-prompt` (**Critical Windows Fix**): Standard terminal TUIs refuse to flush output when stdin/stdout are piped in a long-running process. To bypass this, Tlamatini spawns the CLI fresh on each turn, passes the prompt as a CLI argument, and captures the stdout/stderr stream upon EOF.
- `json-acp`: Strict JSON messaging over stdin/stdout (e.g., used by `tlamatini` self-host).
- `tui-repl`: Long-lived REPL shell. Uses reader threads to pump console stdout to queues.
- `one-shot`: Single task, closes stdin immediately after write.

### 7.2 Skills Runtime & HARNESS
- Skills are defined in directories under `agent/skills_pkg/` containing a `SKILL.md` file with a YAML frontmatter block.
- **Validation**: Inputs and outputs are strictly coerced and validated against the skill's declared schema by `agent/skills/io_contract.py`.
- **Budgets**: Each skill has a `Budget` dataclass enforcing `max_iterations`, `max_seconds`, and `max_tokens` (accumulated from ACPX event streams).
- **Security**: The `PermissionGate` manages capabilities (`approve-reads`, `approve-all`, `deny-all`). In unattended runs, the policy dictates whether to `deny` (return permission-denied to the LLM) or `fail` (hard exit).
- **Admin UI**: Surfaced in the chat navbar under **ACPX-Skills** (Browse / Configure / Diagnostics / Reload).
  - *Browse*: Inspector modal.
  - *Configure*: Toggles `Skill.enabled` in the DB.
  - *Diagnostics*: Audits missing tool/MCP dependencies.
  - *Reload*: Runs `boot_skills()` to reload disk modifications without restarting Django.

---

## 8. Windows-Specific Hardening

Tlamatini is designed primarily for Windows, featuring deep integrations that require strict fallback rules.

### 8.1 Native Directory Picker
- Web browsers' standard `showDirectoryPicker()` cannot browse folders outside the client sandbox or handle nested paths under application roots.
- Tlamatini bypasses this by using a backend Win32 folder picker (`views.pick_context_directory_view`).
- **Non-Windows Fallback**: If the OS is not Windows, the view returns a flag instructing the frontend to fall back to a manual text-entry field.

### 8.2 The conhost.exe Reaper
To prevent task manager pollution (where companion `conhost.exe` processes would linger bearing the Tlamatini icon), the app runs a three-tier reaper (`agent/orphan_reaper.py`):

| Tier | Run Location | Scope |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Tier 1 (After Tool)** | `MultiTurnToolAgentExecutor._reap_after_tool()` | Zombie/dead child PIDs of `os.getpid()` + parentless `conhost.exe` / `openconsole.exe` whose command line matches our tree. (Cheap check) |
| **Tier 2 (After Chat)** | `AgentConsumer._tier2_orphan_sweep()` (Background thread) | Same as Tier 1 + full command line scan of active/dead pools under `agents/pools/` or `_chat_runs_`. Broadcasts a WS alert warning the user if zombies survive. |
| **Tier 3 (Shutdown)** | `AgentConfig.ready()` (Atexit/SIGINT hooks) | Complete sweep of the entire application space. Kills all remaining console-host orphans. |

- **Monkeypatch Seatbelt**: Every visual agent python script inherits a monkey-patch on `subprocess.Popen.__init__` (`_chg_guarded_init`) that defaults `creationflags` to `CREATE_NO_WINDOW` to prevent console windows from spawning at all unless explicitly requested.

---

### 8.3 Companion-App Discovery (Tlamatini-FlowPills)

So sister XAIHT apps like **Tlamatini-FlowPills** can find Tlamatini's agent-template catalog at startup WITHOUT importing Python, running Tlamatini, or scanning drives, Tlamatini publishes three read-only, **HKCU-only, fail-open** surfaces: the registry key `HKCU\Software\XAIHT\Tlamatini` (six `REG_SZ` values — `InstallLocation`, `AgentsRoot`, `SourceAgentsRoot`, `AgentManifestPath`, `Version`, `AgentCatalogVersion`; all six written every call, empty when unknown), the `_tlamatini_agents_manifest.json` next to the agents (complete templates only, per-file `sha256`, `utf-8-sig` read), and the `.tlamatini-preserved-agents.json` marker the uninstaller leaves (with `manifest_sha256`; the discovery key is KEPT). Engine `agent/agent_manifest.py` + `agent/windows_app_registration.py`; wired into `apps.py` (scheduled FIRST in `ready()`, import-independent, dedicated idempotency gate), `install.py` (independent of the ARP entry), `uninstall.py`, `build.py`. Filesystem is authoritative; 17 Django-free secret-safe tests in `agent/test_agent_manifest.py`. Contract: `docs/companion-app-discovery.md`; implements `Tlamatini-FlowPills-Lookup.md` §15 + second-sprint hardening.

### 8.3b Truthful Exec-Report Verdicts (`agent_verdict.py`) — closed vocabulary in v1.48.15

The Exec Report's per-row SUCCESS/FAILED verdict is decided by a **deterministic expert system**, not by the child process's exit code.

**The bug it kills.** Two different questions were collapsed into one string: PROCESS (*"did the child exit 0?"* — one bit) and AGENT (*"did the agent do the job, and what did it FIND?"* — a typed record). `tools._launch_wrapped_chat_agent` set `payload["status"]` from the exit code, and the attempt to lift the agent's own `status:` used `payload.setdefault(...)` — a silent NO-OP on exactly that key. Live consequence: LaTeXer's linter, asked to check a deliberately broken document, found the bug exactly as designed and the Exec Report stamped it a red **FAILURE**.

**How it works.** A lexer/parser turns the `INI_SECTION` self-report into a typed AST (`SectionNode` → `KVNode` → coerced values); an **ordered** production-rule table returns a `Verdict` carrying its rule id and the evidence that fired it. No model call, no heuristics.

| rule | fires on | verdict |
|---|---|---|
| R1 | no self-report | the exit code |
| R2 | `error` / `failed` | FAILED |
| R3 | `refused` / `not_found` / `not_unique` / `engine_unavailable` (work did NOT happen) | FAILED |
| R3b | degraded or compromised deliverable (`tokens_only`, `compiled_with_errors`, `operator_required`, …) | FAILED |
| R4 | read-only diagnostic completed — `invalid`, `findings`, `no_matches`, `listed` … | **SUCCESS** |
| R5 | explicit `success:` / `ok:` | that boolean |
| R6 | non-zero `errors:` (`"0"` is not a failure) | FAILED |
| R7 | nothing decisive + non-zero exit | FAILED |
| R7b | named intact completion (`ok`, `completed`, `sent`, `created`, …) | SUCCESS |
| R8b | unknown status token | fail-open SUCCESS, token named in provenance |
| R8 | no failure signal | SUCCESS |

**ORDER IS THE ALGORITHM — R4 must outrank R5 and R6.** A linter that worked perfectly reports `status: invalid` **and** `success: False` **and** `errors: 2` in the same breath; the last two describe the **document**, not the agent.

**Contract (do NOT weaken):** the agent's self-report OUTRANKS the exit code; it is NEVER dropped (on a key collision the process view stays under `<key>` and the agent view lands on `agent_<key>` — both survive); a read-only diagnostic reporting an adverse finding has **SUCCEEDED**, while a degraded or missing deliverable is red; **fail-open** — every parse error resolves to "no opinion" and nothing may raise into a caller; stdlib-only and imports nothing from `agent.*` (so no `tools.py` ↔ `mcp_agent.py` import cycle, identical frozen and from source). The one vocabulary is five disjoint sets in `agent_verdict.py`, united as `KNOWN_STATUSES`; `mcp_agent` aliases them rather than re-inlining a copy.

**If you author an agent**: its `status:` is load-bearing — READ, not decoration. Reuse one token from `KNOWN_STATUSES`; numeric results belong under `returncode` or `exit_code`. A read-only diagnostic must exit `0` even when it finds problems; never tie the exit code to how clean the user's input was. Pinned by `agent/test_agent_verdict.py`, `agent/test_exec_report_verdict.py`, and the repository-wide `agent/test_status_vocabulary.py` guard.

---

### 8.4 Configurable Web Port (`django_port`) — v1.40.1

Tlamatini's web UI + chat WebSocket port is **no longer hardcoded to 8000** — `8000` is only the *default*. It lives in `config.json` as **`django_port`**. `manage.py::_resolve_django_port()` reads and range-validates it, and `manage.py::_apply_configured_port()` injects it into `sys.argv` for **every** launch path: the frozen double-click, the `.flw` file association, the frozen browser auto-open, source `runserver`, and `startserver`. Both helpers are deliberately **stdlib-only** (they run BEFORE Django is imported — never make them import `agent.*`). Two invariants, pinned by 24 tests in `agent/test_django_port_config.py`: (1) **fail-open** — a missing / unreadable / non-numeric / out-of-range value falls back to 8000 and prints `--- [PORT] …`, so a config typo can never stop startup; (2) **an explicit CLI `[ipaddr:]port` always wins** (`runserver 9100`), and the injector never double-appends onto the frozen `0.0.0.0:<port>` rewrite. Why it exists: where Windows/Hyper-V has RESERVED port 8000, Daphne cannot bind it and the app died with `WinError 10013` — a frozen install had no escape short of a rebuild. Not covered by the key (by design): a direct `daphne`/`uvicorn` launch, the MCP helper listeners `:8765` / `:50051`, and TeleTlamatini's own `tlamatini.base_url`. Contract: `docs/claude/architecture.md` → *Configurable web port*.

### 8.5 Chat Screenshot Ingest — Ctrl+V paste / drag-and-drop (2026-07-14)

- The user pastes a screenshot into the chat box (**Ctrl+V**, after PrtScn/snip) or drops image files onto the chat column.
- `agent/static/agent/js/chat_image_paste.js` (self-contained IIFE, **no cross-file globals**) POSTs the blob to **`/agent/paste_image/`** → `views.paste_image_view`, which re-encodes it to JPEG (Pillow; alpha flattened onto white; 25 MB cap) and writes it to `<app>/Temp/image_<timestamp>.jpg` via `path_guard.resolve_temp_path()` (Temp policy).
- The browser then splices the returned **absolute path into the chat box at the caret** and renders a thumbnail chip (`#chat-image-chips`). The point is that a *path* — not an attachment — is what **Image-Interpreter** consumes, so the next prompt is immediately actionable. `prompt.pmt` tells the LLM to treat an `image_<timestamp>.jpg` under Temp as *the* image the user means.
- **Two contracts (do NOT break):** the `paste` listener is on `document` (after Alt+Tab focus sits on `<body>`, so a textarea-scoped listener never fires — the caret is remembered separately), and `agent_page_layout.js::computeFormMinHeight()` **must count the chips row** because it pins `#tools-chat-form-container` to an explicit pixel height (an uncounted row pushes the textarea + Send off-screen). Full contract: `docs/claude/recent-fixes.md` (2026-07-14).

## 11. Coding Rules & Recent Fix Contracts

Ensure all future edits strictly adhere to these locked contracts:

### 12.1 Ruff and Parse-Gate
- `pythonxer.py` runs a syntax parse gate `compile()` followed by `validate_with_ruff()`.
- If Ruff reports an error and `ruff_blocking: true` is set, execution is aborted, returning `False`.
- Failure is passed back to `tools.py` with `retryable=True` so the LLM must fix the code and try again.

### 12.2 Pythonxer Downstream Trigger
- **Unconditional downstream trigger**: Pythonxer MUST always start its target downstream agents in a flow, regardless of exit status (0 or 1). Downstream agents do any result-checking.

### 12.3 Secret Key Precision (Reviewer)
- The Reviewer agent must verify git status and treat unstaged changes as uncommitted.
- The `regen_secrets.py` scrub pattern must be respected so local developer keys in `config.json` are not accidentally flagged as leaks.

### 12.4 Playwright in Async Channels Loop
- Any Playwright script executed synchronously must wrap its execution inside a `ThreadPoolExecutor` to avoid ASGI block errors.
